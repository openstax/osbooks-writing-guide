      <contenttitle>Peer Review: Conferencing in Writing Groups</contenttitle>
      <contentdata type="introduction">
      <para>A writing conference is an opportunity for focused, constructive conversation between readers and writers. During this time, peer readers can ask for clarity and provide immediate feedback. The experience allows you to expand or deepen your understanding of the writing process and think about the overall effectiveness of your proposal. After the conference, you’ll have a chance to revise your writing.</para> 
      <para>With a small group, read the following portion of a sample proposal to participate in a mock group writing conference.</para>

      <para>In 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan, started to receive national attention after it was determined their drinking water was contaminated with lead. Lead contamination in drinking water due to rusty and decayed piping is a serious environmental concern. Since low-income communities with predominantly Black and Hispanic residents living in inadequate housing were disproportionately affected, the crisis was labeled a form of environmental racism.</para> 
      <para>Stephanie, a single mother in Flint, Michigan, made multiple visits to the doctor’s office because her 8-year-old son, John, became ill following consumption of the city’s drinking water. </para>

     <para>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located between Hawaii and California. As the name implies, this stretch of ocean highlights the urgent threat that plastic poses to our environment. In this 1.6 million square kilometer area lives over 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, weighing in at 80,000 metric tons. Unfortunately, the patch is growing. Plastic bags have created an environmental emergency, threatening ocean biodiversity.</para>

     <para>“In one just one year, about 660 billion pounds of plastic are produced worldwide. About 40% of that is single-use plastic, such as plastic bags and packaging. While many countries have banned or restricted single-use plastic, the United States has been slow to regulate its use. To protect the environment, plastic bags should be banned and replaced with reusable shopping bags. While critics argue that reusable bags are not the solution, research shows that reusable bags can immediately reduce plastic waste on a large scale.</para>

        <para><p>Peer review should:</p>
        <ul class="ul-summary">

<p>After providing specific feedback, as you’ve done here, end with a general discussion. Discuss issues where you struggled to find consensus as a group or provide additional actionable suggestions. Remember to frame your discussion in terms of the reader’s understanding and reaction based on the defined rhetorical situation.<p>
