      <para id="para-00002">As part of this course, you are creating a portfolio of your compositions to show your development as a writer. As you add to this portfolio, you assess your growth as a writer. The portfolio of your work allows you not only to have a record of your compositions but also to reflect on those compositions and the process involved in writing them. In this section, you will write a reflection on the process you followed in writing your turning-point story, including revision and editing. Consider your original intention when creating your essay and how close your final composition comes to fulfilling that intention.</para>
      <section id="sect-00002">
      <title>Reflective Task</title>
      <para id="para-00003">Answer the following questions before writing several paragraphs reflecting on the personal turning point you wrote about in this chapter. Consider both the process and the outcome of the writing assignment.</para>
      <list type="enumerated" id="list-00002">
      <item>Why did you choose the turning-point moment or event that you did?</item>
      <item>Which part of the writing process came the most naturally? Which was the most difficult?</item>
      <item>Which parts of the composition do you think are the strongest? Why?</item>
      <item>Which parts of the composition would you still like to improve?</item>
      <item>How did you develop your voice as a narrator as you wrote?</item>
      <item>If you were to write another turning-point story, what would you do differently? (Consider topic, organization, structure, point of view, and voice.)</item>
      <item>How did your story change through the revision and peer-editing processes? Name at least two changes you made, and reflect on how they made the piece stronger.</item>
      <item>What did you learn about yourself, both as a writer and as a person, from this exercise?</item>
