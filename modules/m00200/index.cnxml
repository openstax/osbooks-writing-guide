    <title>Errata</title>
    <para id="para-00006">All OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. Writing style guides and other contextual frameworks also change frequently. Since our books are web-based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on OpenStax.org. Subject matter experts review all errata suggestions.

    <title>About <emphasis effect="italics">Writing Guide with Handbook</emphasis></title>
    <para id="para-00008"><emphasis effect="italics">Writing Guide with Handbook</emphasis> bridges the gap between everyday rhetoric and the world of academia by revealing to students that they are already engaged in rhetorical work within the familiar contexts of personal interaction and social media. The text seeks to extend these existing skills by showing students how to construct a variety of compelling compositions within self-defined contexts. <emphasis effect="italics">Writing Guide with Handbook</emphasis> breaks down barriers in the field of composition by offering an inviting and inclusive approach to students of all intersectional identities. To meet this goal, the text creates a reciprocal relationship between everyday rhetoric and the evolving world of academia, which must allow itself to be shaped by students as much as it seeks to shape them.</para>
    <para id="para-00009"><emphasis effect="italics">Writing Guide with Handbook</emphasis> was conceived in 2020—the year that brought everything into question for students and instructors alike. Would we avert the climate crisis? Would we survive a global pandemic? Would we achieve gender equality? Would we finally acknowledge that Black lives and Black linguistics matter? Would we show acceptance toward refugees and Dreamers? Would we embrace multilingualism? How would we navigate our way through one existential crisis after another? Put simply, the answer for some of us has become that we write . . . we write for our lives. We write calls to action on social media. We write protest signs to carry in the streets. We write proposed legislation to create change. We write our stories . . . and we write the stories of those who cannot write their own.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">In a world with so many questions and seemingly so few answers, the writing classroom as supported by <emphasis effect="italics">Writing Guide with Handbook</emphasis> becomes an essential space for navigating hard conversations about <emphasis effect="italics">what is right</emphasis> versus <emphasis effect="italics">what is easy</emphasis>. The text invites students and instructors to practice invitational, rather than confrontational, verbal and written conversations. These classroom communities will learn to communicate about culture in its broadest sense without divisiveness. Instructors will be empowered to emphasize meaning and voice over outdated writing traditions and to teach empathy as a rhetorical strategy. Students will be empowered to negotiate their identities and their cultures through language as they, too, join us in writing for their lives.</para>

    <title>Pedagogical Foundation</title>
    <para id="para-00011">The OpenStax <emphasis effect="italics">Writing Guide with Handbook</emphasis> is organized according to relevant writing genres, with the writing process, effective writing practices or strategies—including graphic organizers, writing frames, and word banks to support visual learning—and conventions of usage and style contextually embedded. The text includes an editing and documentation handbook, which is linked to the Editing Focus feature located in each genre chapter. This organizational approach allows instructors and students to focus on the importance of argumentation and research. In addition, the text allows for nimble customization based on inclusive assignments that welcome all voices and experiences to the academic forum as appropriate to the teaching styles of individual instructors and writing programs.</para>

    <title>Highlights</title>
   <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00001">
    <item><para id="para-00055"><emphasis effect="bold">Cultural awareness</emphasis> is a defined outcome of the text. As a standalone aspect of the rhetorical situation, this outcome supports a culturally integrated pedagogical approach. As such, it is evident throughout the text. In addition, multiculturalism is supported by a repeating chapter-level feature on diverse trailblazers who are working innovatively within each genre. Annotated writing samples in each chapter cross time, space, and culture to emphasize the contributions of many to the genre. There is also a chapter titled “Language, Identity, and Culture,” which focuses on contemporary cultural issues and invites students to participate in the ongoing dialogue over the power of language to define and shape both identity and culture. Students of all identities are invited to write about and reflect on their personal experiences with rhetoric in public or private settings. Writing assignments are inclusive so as to invite a wide range of subjects, voices, and viewpoints into the classroom, reinforcing the idea that all are welcome and respected. Writing assignments also include suggestions for differing cultural or linguistic approaches. In addition, writing practices and graphic organizers are marked by targeted icons with regard to culture, linguistics, and learning styles to help instructors and students scaffold assignments.</para>

    </item>
    <item><para id="para-00012"><emphasis effect="bold">Critical language awareness</emphasis> is an important part of the goal of cultural awareness. The text invites and encourages instructors and students to openly and regularly challenge and question accepted conventions and practices with regard to language use with the understanding that language both results from and transmits social, political, and ideological beliefs and practices. In so doing, language is a force of both liberation and oppression. Critical language awareness is a journey, not an end destination. As language grows and evolves, so too must our willingness to engage with it in culturally inclusive ways.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">With this awareness in mind, OpenStax has not censored the racial slur that appears in the excerpt from Frederick Douglass’s autobiography in Chapter 3. Because the issues regarding the usage of the word are complex and evolving, instructors may choose to discuss with students the usage of the word in the text and how that might differ from the practice of reading it aloud in the class, for example. For support, the introduction to the text provides a research-based discussion of the term and its usage.</para></item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Process orientation</emphasis> is supported by two different chapter structures that move students through the writing process in elongated and abbreviated ways. Five genre assignments guide students through a complete experience with the writing process, including formatting that is relevant to the genre. Other optional writing assignments feature an abbreviated process so that instructors and students are afforded the time to build out their courses in customized ways. Complex genres such as position argument and argumentative research are covered through a multiple-chapter approach so that students are supported throughout the writing process. Each of the genre chapters includes modeling through an annotated sample, a Quick Launch guide that includes a graphic organizer to get students started writing, and an evaluation rubric that informs the drafting process. Finally, students are encouraged in the ongoing construction and self-evaluation of a writing portfolio through a concluding feature in each chapter and a final chapter titled “Portfolio Reflection.”</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Editing in context</emphasis> is supported through a chapter-level Editing Focus feature that calls out a particular editing issue related to the genre. The feature instructs students in recognizing and editing the error. Each Editing Focus feature is linked to the appropriate section of the Handbook, as these editing focuses are based on the 10 most important editing topics as suggested by instructors of writing. Given that the <emphasis effect="italics">Modern Language Association Handbook</emphasis>, 9th edition, was published in 2021, simultaneous to the developmental process of this text, OpenStax has relied on the <emphasis effect="italics">Modern Language Association Handbook</emphasis>, 8th edition, for citation information. Any discrepancies will be addressed in a future reprint of this text.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Information and media literacy</emphasis> is supported through specific chapters, such as “Multimodal and Online Writing” and “Image Analysis.” In addition, the Genre Trailblazer feature includes those who work in genres such as newspapers, visual arts, and film.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Media assets</emphasis> are featured in 14 chapters. These assets invite students to consider and practice the application of varying genre characteristics as well as steps in the writing process, such as peer review and revision.</item>

    <title>Key Features</title>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Learning Outcomes</emphasis> begin each numbered section. These sets of clear and concise outcomes have been thoroughly revised to be both measurable and closely aligned with current teaching practice. These outcomes are designed to help the instructor decide what content to include or assign and to guide student expectations of learning. After completing each chapter and writing assignment, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning outcomes.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Genre Trailblazer</emphasis> introduces and grounds each chapter by presenting one of a diverse group of contemporary artists who are doing innovative work within the genre. Discussion questions invite students to consider the ways in which each trailblazer is working within or challenging the conventions of a genre.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Glance at Genre</emphasis> introduces students to each genre through key characteristics and important terminology.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Annotated Sample Readings</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="bold">Student Samples</emphasis> provide alternating annotated readings by professional authors and student writers. The annotations point out characteristics of each genre. Discussion questions invite students to consider the ways in which authors meet or challenge these characteristics.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Writing Process</emphasis> steps present students with a writing assignment in each chapter genre and then lead them through a recursive drafting process. This section provides students with Quick Launch strategies, graphic organizers, samples and models, and invitations to develop their assignments in varying ways.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Editing Focus</emphasis> presents students with an editing focus and then invites them to practice and apply the focus in a number of ways. This feature, as well as other activities, will also be addressed in the instructor’s manual and the student toolkit so that instructors can use it flexibly.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Evaluation</emphasis> is approached through a sample rubric, which is provided for every assignment.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Spotlight on . . .</emphasis> provides students with additional information on topics related to the genres.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Portfolio Reflections</emphasis> help students incorporate each assignment into ongoing portfolios. Students are encouraged throughout the text to keep course portfolios in print or digital format.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="bold">Further Reading</emphasis> helps students further explore the chapter genre through references and links to other information sources.</item>
