      <para id="para-00002">As you think about the problem for your proposal, it is important to understand the rhetorical situation, or the circumstance in which a writer communicates with an audience of readers, including your purpose, audience expectations, and the key elements of the proposal genre. The rhetorical situation and its relationship to writing your proposal is discussed more fully in <link document="m00063">Writing Process: Creating a Proposal</link>.</para>
      <section id="sect-00002">
      <title>Defining Your Purpose</title>
      <para id="para-00003">Your <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">purpose</term> is your reason for writing. The broad purpose for most academic and real-world proposals is to offer a solution to a problem. You, the writer, are tasked with identifying a problem and recommending a solution. You may need to write a proposal for a research project in a sociology class, or you may need to write a business proposal for a marketing class or a business you’ve started. Many topics are suitable for a proposal in a college writing class. For example, some problems are local and can be acted on directly, such as improving access to mental health services on your campus, offering a new food delivery option to campus buildings, designating quiet study spaces in your library, or bringing a farmer’s market to your campus. Others are large-scale, research-oriented proposals such as reducing automobile emissions, providing broadband Internet access nationwide, or reforming immigration policies in the United States. Read your assignment carefully, and be sure you know the requirements and the amount of flexibility you have.</para>

      <title>Tuning in to Audience Expectations</title>
      <para id="para-00004">The <term id="term-00002">audience</term> for your writing consists of the people who will read it or who could read it. <emphasis effect="italics">Are you writing for your instructor? For your classmates? For students or administrators on your campus or people in your community?</emphasis> Think about the action they can take to solve the problem. For example, if the problem you’re presenting is a lack of diverse food options on your campus, a proposal to other students would perhaps ask students to join you in calling for change in dining options, whereas a proposal to administrators would request specific changes.</para>
      <para id="para-00005">Whoever your readers are, they expect you to do the following:</para>
      <list id="list-00002">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Address a specific, well-defined problem.</emphasis> As the writer, ensure that your readers know what the problem is and why it needs to be solved. Some problems are well-known, whereas others need to be explained.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Have an idea of what they already know.</emphasis> It is up to you as the writer to learn as much as possible about your audience. You need to know how receptive your audience may be to your suggestions and what they know about the problem you’re proposing to solve. Their knowledge—or lack thereof—will require you to adjust your writing as needed. If readers are new to the problem, they expect you to provide the necessary background information. If they are knowledgeable about the problem, they expect you to cover background information quickly.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Provide reliable information.</emphasis> in the form of specific facts, statistics, and examples. Whether you present your own research or information from sources, readers expect you to have done your homework and present trustworthy information about the problem and the solution.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Structure your proposal in a logical way.</emphasis> Open with an introduction that tells readers the subject of the proposal, and follow with a logical structure.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Adopt an objective stance.</emphasis> Writing objectively means adopting a position and tone that are neutral and free from bias, personal feelings, and emotional language. In doing so, you show respect for your readers’ knowledge and intelligence, and you build credibility and trust, or <term id="term-00003">ethos</term>, with your readers.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Tell them what you want them to do in response to your proposal.</emphasis> Do you want them to engage other members of the community? Build something? Contact their legislators? Although they may not do what you want, they are unlikely to act at all if you don’t tell them what you would like them to do.</item>
