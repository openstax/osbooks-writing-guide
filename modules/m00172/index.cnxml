    <para id="para-00002">Ask a peer to use the following rubric to evaluate your final presentation draft. The rubric covers oral fluency, rhetorical choices, and organizational principles necessary for creating a strong presentation. After going through the rubric, your peer reviewer may leave comments or other feedback to help you understand their reasoning. Although you may not agree with all of their ideas, peer reviewers offer an opportunity for you to get an outsider’s perspective on your writing. Be sure to ask questions about parts you do not understand, and listen closely to your peer reviewer’s reasoning. Then review your script again according to the feedback you think you can address.</para>

    <entry>The outline and its delivery have a somewhat clear focus and thesis, exemplify some oral fluency, and appeal somewhat to readers’ intelligence and sympathies. The text also shows limited evidence of the writer’s intent to meet or challenge conventional expectations in rhetorically effective ways.</entry>

The writer’s ideas are presented fairly clearly, but the writing may be choppy because of insufficient or inappropriate transitions. The conclusion may be missing or may not tie back to the thesis. Media and visual aids may not be used appropriately as support—too many, too few, too small, or inaudible.</entry>
    <entry>The language is usually clear but may be inappropriate at times and may not always reflect the overall tone. The writer demonstrates some awareness of the audience and use of rhetorical strategies and devices, such as parallelism and repetition, but more are needed for a strong presentation.</entry>
