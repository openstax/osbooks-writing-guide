    <title>Lights, Camera Angles, Actions</title>
    <para id="para-00002">This chapter focuses largely on still images, but many of the same principles apply to moving images, or film. Documentaries in particular combine a series of still or moving images with historical and narrative text. This section shows how the concepts of visual rhetoric apply to the documentary work of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Ken Burns</term>. It also encourages you to examine your experience through such techniques by creating a film autobiography.</para>
    <para class="annotation culture-icon" id="para-00003">The field of movie and film artistry is vast, constituting an entire field of study in its own right. One notable figure in the field is the American history film documentarian Ken Burns (b. 1953), who is responsible for nearly 200 films as writer, director, producer, or all of the above. From <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002"><emphasis effect="italics">The Civil War</emphasis></term> (1990) to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">The Vietnam War</emphasis></term> (2017), from <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004"><emphasis effect="italics">Jackie Robinson</emphasis></term> (2016) to <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005"><emphasis effect="italics">Country Music</emphasis></term> (2019), Ken Burns has documented the American experience in richer and more layered ways than can be achieved via print text alone.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">Burns’s style is deceptively simple. His documentaries are narrated in an informative, objective manner, sometimes by a well-known figure in politics, sports, or entertainment whose work is related to the documentary topic. The images consist of archival footage, which differs depending on the topic, ranging from black-and-white photographs to grainy home videos. These are interspersed with interviews from eyewitnesses and experts.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">Of the many techniques that Burns employs, three are of particular interest: <term id="term-00006">foreshadowing</term>, <term id="term-00007">the personal vs. the universal</term>, and <term id="term-00008">juxtaposition</term>.</para>
    <section id="sect-00003">
    <title>Foreshadowing</title>
    <para id="para-00006">Documentaries are not known for being riveting, suspenseful, edge-of-your seat thrillers, but Ken Burns keeps audiences enthralled for hours on end. <emphasis effect="italics">The Civil War</emphasis>, for example, consists of nine episodes totaling 11 hours and 30 minutes. One important way Burns keeps audiences engaged is by implying that things are not as they seem or that a major change is just on the horizon. Such warnings are delivered by his narrators often just after a peak emotional moment either of contentment and resolution or of fear and anxiety. The effect is to make the audience question what could possibly happen next and to keep them tuned in for the next episode.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00004">
    <title>The Personal vs. the Universal</title>
    <para id="para-00007">History may move in giant sweeps across times and places, but it happens day by day with the mundane choices made by ordinary people. Burns excels at highlighting the small, personal tales of individuals who changed the course of history and the ways massive historical movements affected individual people’s lives. The back-and-forth of these forces plays out in his work like a delicate ballet in which the lead dancers move toward and away from one another on stage, amplifying the tension each time.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-00005">
    <title>Juxtaposition</title>
    <para id="para-00008">Like any serious historian, Burns is interested not merely in <emphasis effect="italics">what</emphasis> happened but also in <emphasis effect="italics">why.</emphasis> This investigation requires that he go beyond appearances, a challenge for a filmmaker who relies on images to make his meaning clear to viewers. Burns often demonstrates for viewers how people and events converge by showing an ordinary American soldier, farmer, or sports figure, for example, alongside a powerful political figure. Alternatively, he may pan out from a newspaper headline only to zoom in on a story printed deep within the fold. In the viewer’s mind, the placement of such figures plants an impression that is immediately upended or replaced. The experience can be jarring, but the technique leads to deep learning and retention, which is one reason Burns’s documentaries leave a lasting impression on his audience.</para>
    <para class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00009">Burns often works in conjunction with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which funds and airs much of his work. To see these techniques in action, visit his page on the PBS website and watch a <link url="https://openstax.org/r/short-clip">short clip of his biography of Jack Johnson</link> (1878–1946), the first Black American heavyweight boxer to became world champion—in the height of the Jim Crow era.</para>

    <caption>Resources for making a film autobiography</caption>
    </table>
    <para id="para-00011">A film autobiography can help you consider the way you use images in discourse. It also serves as good practice in thinking critically about your experiences and their relation to both images and language. Finally, a film autobiography allows you to communicate your experiences and reflections with others, expanding their worldview as well as your own.</para>
