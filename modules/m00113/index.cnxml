Your instructor will tell you whether to substitute visuals for all three paragraphs or just one or two. Put the title at the top of your poster and, if necessary, include explanations of your images. The images you use and the manner in which you arrange them should convey the same ideas you want to express about your subject in writing. The selected images should reflect your critical thinking on your subject and should invite the viewer also to think critically about your subject. You can read more about understanding various aspects of visual rhetoric in Image Analysis: Writing About What You See.

      <title>Structural Paragraph Frames</title>
      <para class="annotation visual-icon" id="para-00005">Once you have determined your reasoning strategy and purpose for a particular paragraph, consider how to develop the evidence within that paragraph through a topic sentence, explanation, and analysis. To do this task, choose the most appropriate structure for a given paragraph from the structures below, and complete the frame according to the prompts. You may alter the frames as needed. Remember that each paragraph that you develop should support your thesis. In other words, make sure that each topic sentence ties back to your thesis.</para>

First, the need for healthcare went up sharply, and healthcare professionals worked many overtime hours and risked their lives to diagnose and treat others, with the hope of saving them. Consequently, these people became heroes. Also, because most people stayed at home and restaurants were closed, people purchased more food from grocery stores. Therefore, the people who delivered the food to grocery stores and the essential workers at the grocery stores became heroes to those who depended on their services.</para>
