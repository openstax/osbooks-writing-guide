      <title>Defining a Specific Purpose</title>
      <para id="para-00003">Your <term id="term-00001">purpose</term> is your reason for writing. The purpose of a report is to inform; as the writer, you are tasked with providing information and explaining it to readers. Many topics are suitable for informative writing—how to find a job, the way a disease spreads within a population, or the items on which people spend the most money. Some textbooks are examples of informative writing, as is much of the reporting you find on reputable news sites.</para>
      <para id="para-00004">An analytical report is a type of report. Its purpose is to present and analyze information. An assignment for an analytical report will likely include words such as <emphasis effect="italics">analyze</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">compare</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">contrast</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">cause</emphasis>, and/or <emphasis effect="italics">discuss</emphasis>, indicating the specific purpose of the report. Here are a few examples:</para>
      <list id="list-00002">
      <item>Discuss and <term id="term-00003">analyze</term> potential career paths with strong employment prospects for young adults.</item>

      <title>Tuning In to Audience Expectations</title>
      <para id="para-00005">The <term id="term-00012">audience</term> for your report consists of the people who will read it or who could read it. <emphasis effect="italics">Are you writing for your instructor? For your classmates? For other students and teachers in professional fields or academic disciplines? For people in your community?</emphasis> Whoever your readers are, they expect you to do the following:</para>
      <list id="list-00003">
      <item>Have an idea of what they already know about your topic, and adjust your writing as needed. If readers are new to the topic, they expect you to provide necessary background information. If they are knowledgeable about the topic, they will expect you to cover the background quickly.</item>
      <item>Provide reliable information in the form of specific facts, statistics, and examples. Whether you present your own research or information from other sources, readers expect you to have done your homework in order to supply trustworthy information.</item>
      <item>Define terms, especially if audience members may be unfamiliar with your topic.</item>
      <item>Structure your report in a logical way. It should open with an introduction that tells readers the subject and should follow a logical structure.</item>
      <item>Adopt an objective stance and neutral tone, free of any bias, personal feelings, or emotional language. By demonstrating objectivity, you show respect for your readers’ knowledge and intelligence, and you build credibility and trust, or <term id="term-00013">ethos</term>, with them.</item>
      <item>Present and cite source information fairly and accurately.</item>

      <title>Informal Reports</title>
      <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00006">An <term id="term-00014">informal</term> analytical report will identify a problem, provide factual information about the problem, and draw conclusions about the information. An informal report is usually structured like an essay, with an introduction or summary, body paragraphs, and a conclusion or recommendations. It will likely feature headings identifying key sections and be presented in academic essay format, such as <link target-id="sect-00012" document="m00184">MLA Documentation and Format</link> or <link target-id="sect-00013" document="m00184">APA Documentation and Format</link>. For an example of an informal analytical report documented in APA style, see Trevor Garcia’s paper on the U.S. response to COVID-19 in 2020 in the <link document="m00082">Annotated Student Sample</link>.</para>
      <para id="para-00007">Other types of informal reports include journalism reports. A traditional journalism report involves a reporter for a news organization reporting on the day’s events—the results of an election, a political crisis, a plane crash, a celebrity marriage—on TV, on radio, or in print. An investigative journalism report, on the other hand, involves reporters doing original research over a period of weeks or months to uncover significant new information, similar to what Barbara Ehrenreich did for her book <emphasis effect="italics">Nickel and Dimed</emphasis>. For sample traditional and investigative journalistic reports, visit the website of a reliable news organization or publication, such as the <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/newyorktimes">New York Times</link></emphasis>, the <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/washingtonpost">Washington Post</link></emphasis>, the <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/wallstreetjournal">Wall Street Journal</link></emphasis>, the <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/economist">Economist</link>,</emphasis> the <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/newyorker">New Yorker</link></emphasis>, or the <emphasis effect="italics"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/atlantic">Atlantic</link></emphasis>.</para>

      <section id="sect-00005">
      <title>Formal Reports</title>
      <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00008">Writers in the social sciences, the natural sciences, technical fields, and business often write <term id="term-00015">formal</term> analytical reports. These include lab reports, research reports, and proposals.</para>
      <para id="para-00009">Formal reports present findings and data drawn from experiments, surveys, and research and often end with a conclusion based on an analysis of these findings and data. These reports frequently include visuals such as graphs, bar charts, pie charts, photographs, or diagrams that are captioned and referred to in the text. Formal reports always cite sources of information, often using <link target-id="sect-00013" document="m00184">APA Documentation and Format</link>, used in the examples in this chapter, or a similar style.</para>
      <para id="para-00010">If you are assigned a formal report in a class, follow the instructions carefully. Your instructor will likely explain the assignment in detail and provide explicit directions and guidelines for the research you will need to do (including any permission required by your college or university if you conduct research on human subjects), how to organize the information you gather, and how to write and format your report. A formal report is a complex, highly organized, and often lengthy document with a specified format and sections usually marked by headings.</para>
      <para id="para-00011">Following are the components of a formal analytical report. Depending on the assignment and the audience, a formal report you write may include some or all of these parts. For example, a research report following APA format usually includes a title page, an abstract, headings for components of the body of the report (methods, results, discussion), and a references page. Detailed APA guidelines are available online, including at the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/purdueuniversity">Purdue University Online Writing Lab</link>.</para>
      <section id="sect-00006">
      <title>Components of Formal Analytical Reports</title>
      <list id="list-00004">
      <item><term id="term-00016">Letter of transmittal</term>. When a report is submitted, it is usually accompanied by a letter or email to the recipient explaining the nature of the report and signed by those responsible for writing it. Write the letter of transmittal when the report is finished and ready for submission.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00017">Title page</term>. The title page includes the title of the report, the name(s) of the author(s), and the date it was written or submitted. The report title should describe the report simply, directly, and clearly and should not try to be too clever. For example, <emphasis effect="italics">The New Student Writing Project: A Two-Year Report</emphasis> is a clear, descriptive title, whereas <emphasis effect="italics">Write On, Students!</emphasis> is not.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00018">Acknowledgments</term>. If other people and/or organizations contributed to the report, include a page or paragraph thanking them.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00019">Table of contents</term>. For long reports (10 pages or more), create a table of contents to help readers navigate easily. List the major components and subsections of the report and the pages on which they begin.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00020">Executive summary</term> <emphasis effect="bold">or</emphasis> <term id="term-00045">abstract</term>. The executive summary or abstract is a paragraph that highlights the findings of the report. The purpose of this section is to present information in the quickest, most concentrated, and most economical way possible to be useful to readers. Write this section after you have completed the rest of the report.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00021">Introduction</term> <emphasis effect="bold">or</emphasis> <term id="term-00046">background</term>. The introduction provides necessary background information to help readers understand the report. This section also indicates what information is included in the report.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00022">Methods</term>. Especially in the social sciences, the natural sciences, and technical disciplines, the methods or procedures section outlines how you gathered information and from what sources, such as experiments, surveys, library research, interviews, and so on.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00023">Results</term>. In the results section, you summarize the data you have collected from your research, explain your method of analysis, and present this information in detail, often in a table, graph, or chart.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00024">Discussion</term> <emphasis effect="bold">or</emphasis> <term id="term-00047">Conclusion</term>. In this section, you interpret the results and present the conclusions of your research. This section also may be called “Discussion of Findings.”</item>
      <item><term id="term-00025">Recommendations</term>. In this section, you explain what you believe should be done in response to your research findings.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00026">References</term> <emphasis effect="bold">and</emphasis> <term id="term-00048">bibliography</term>. The references section includes every source you cited in the report. The bibliography contains, in addition to those cited in the report, sources that readers can consult to learn more.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00027">Appendix</term>. An appendix (plural: <emphasis effect="italics">appendices</emphasis>) includes documents that are related to the report or contain information that can be culled but are not deemed central to understanding the report.</item>
