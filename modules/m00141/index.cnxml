      <para id="para-00002">Having learned about case studies and how they help advance research and knowledge, you are ready to do an informal one of your own. You will conduct an informal case study profile by selecting a topic to research, observing a setting and a participant (or participants), and using specified research methods. If applicable, see <link document="m00125">The Research Process: How to Create Sources</link> for more information about selecting a research topic. You will then analyze the results of your study to determine its significance.</para>
      <para id="para-00003">As indicated in <link document="m00137">Tracing a Broad Issue in the Individual</link>, many universities and professional organizations will provide guidance on how to adhere to ethical standards when conducting a case study. Your instructor will be your best resource for answers to questions you have about your college’s policies on conducting research and whether and how they apply to the research you intend to do. Remember, however, that for any research you do involving human subjects, you must obtain participants’ written permission to be included in your study.</para>

      <title>Summary of Assignment</title>
      <para class="annotation culture-icon linguistic-icon" id="para-00004">Conduct an informal case study of a classmate, friend, or family member to gain insight into the participant’s use of language, specifically the ways in which their culture(s) and language(s) interact. Try to find a willing participant who is either bilingual or fluent in, familiar with, or an occasional user of a language other than English. You can focus your case study on the ways in which your participant changes their language according to context, how their use of language is different when they interact with family and friends as opposed to in academic or professional contexts, or how using one language affects the other. Be sure to consult your instructor about the school’s policy on student participation in studies, and obtain written permission from the participant before you begin. If you do not know anyone who speaks another language, consider these topics:</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
      <item>Body language that accompanies linguistic communication</item>
      <item>Language shifts according to medium (text, phone call, email, in person)</item>
      <item>In-person vs. written communication</item>
      <item>Comparison of language use between two participants from different cultures or age groups</item>
      </list>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00005">After you decide on your topic, formulate a research question that asks precisely what you want to learn from your study. Next, you will need to plan your case study by drafting questions for interviews and conducting observations at determined times and places. Then, using the information you collect from your interviews and observations, you will offer an interpretation about the participant’s use of language that might be helpful to your college’s instructors and administrators. Present your findings in a report of around 1,000 to 1,200 words.</para>

See <link document="m00166">Scripting for the Public Forum: Writing to Speak</link> for more information about scripting for a public forum. For this version of the assignment, record your interviews on video or use a voice recorder. Play clips of your interviews in your presentation to illustrate the participant’s use of language. Organize the presentation into clear, distinct sections with subtitles. Instead of long, dense paragraphs, use short bullet points to state your main points. Use visuals to communicate abstract ideas or data. Make sure your presentation flows logically and that you use appropriate transitions to maintain coherence. To indicate clear demarcations between sections, use headings and subheadings, as in the <link document="m00140">Annotated Sample Reading</link>.

      <title>Data Collection</title>
      <para id="para-00022">Before starting your actual research, get a sense of the body of knowledge around your topic. Remember, case studies are about advancing research in a particular field. For a case study to effectively advance knowledge, it must show awareness of the research already done in the field. A literature review section, which includes previous research and background about the topic, is typically included in a case study. Browsing trade publications and academic journals can help you get a sense of existing research. Looking for articles frequently referred to in other articles is a good way to locate important research, as researchers typically cite significant studies. Look at important, groundbreaking research in addition to recently published work. The information you gather from existing literature may be either qualitative or quantitative. See <link document="m00125">The Research Process: Where to Look for Existing Sources</link> for more information about conducting research.</para>

      <title/>
      <para id="para-00023">After you have established your research question, you can begin your actual study. Start by planning how you will collect your primary source data. First, review the literature in the field if you have not yet done so. Next, draft questions to ask your case study participant. The strongest case studies provide a unique perspective that is applicable to your specific audience—in this case, students, teachers, and administrators at your college. Keep in mind that not every college is the same. Some colleges, such as “open admissions” community colleges, admit all who apply, whereas other colleges accept only 5 percent or fewer of their applicants. Interview questions are likely to be different depending on the individual characteristics of your college. To learn more about your college and its student population, search for information on the college website. Look for sections that have titles such as “About Us,” “About Our Students,” “College Facts” / “Factbook,” and so on.</para>

      <title>Create Interview Questions</title>
      <para class="annotation linguistic-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00025">Using your research and brainstorming ideas, draft a series of 10 to 15 questions you plan to ask your case study participant. Remember that these questions should be open-ended (no yes-or-no questions) and give the participant an opportunity to speak freely and extemporaneously. There are no right or wrong answers. With these questions, keep your purpose in mind: to gather information that will be helpful to students, teachers, and administrators about how a student at Midlands (or another school) uses language. Here are some sample questions:</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
      <item>What are your hobbies, or what do you do for entertainment? (This question should elicit responses that provide insight into the student’s leisure activities and the groups they identify with.)</item>
      <item>What new language uses did you have to develop when you became a college student?</item>
      <item>If you have a job in addition to being a student, what are some ways you use language to do that job?</item>
      <item>How do you communicate with friends and family? (Text messages? Apps such as Snapchat? Phone calls?)</item>
      <item>Describe your style of text messaging. (Probe for details about situations and contexts.)

      <para id="para-00026">Remember to use the brainstorming and research you did previously to draft appropriate questions for your case study participant. Also, try to find ways to encourage the participant to provide as many details as they can and to identify an appropriate setting in which you can observe them using language.</para>
      <para id="para-00027">Interview the person you have chosen to study. Record their responses on paper or on a digital voice recorder. If using a digital recorder, briefly note anything you want to review later in writing. If you find an opportunity to elicit further information or follow up, do so. You may find it helpful to print the bulleted list of questions and write the participant’s answers directly on the page.</para>

      <title>Field Observation</title>
      <para class="annotation visual-icon linguistic-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00028">The next step is to observe. If you haven’t already done so, decide on a setting in which to observe the participant. You might observe in person and/or use a messaging app or video chat to observe them using language at work, with their friends and family, or in some other setting. The setting should be one in which you can get a good idea of how the participant uses language naturally in that context. For example, you would not want to observe a student playing a video game if they aren’t a gamer. Here are some suggestions about what to note as you observe. Be sure to take detailed notes during your observation. Consider printing this page as well and writing observation notes on it.

First, look closely at the data you have collected, and decide what the information is telling you about how the participant uses language. You should have data gathered from both qualitative and quantitative research. If you need more of either one, interview or observe the participant again, or conduct more background research. In the interactive below, practice identifying qualitative and quantitative data.</para>

      <title>Writing the Introduction: Background, Context, and Methods</title>
      <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00030">In the introduction, provide background and context for the case study. To begin, write a detailed description of the study you have conducted and what you sought to learn from it. Also include the details of your literature review and the methods you used to collect data (interviews, observations, and so on). The example below is an introduction to the Midlands Technical College student’s case study on how students use language:</para>
      <section id="sect-00010">
      <title>Background and Context</title>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00031">Midlands Technical College is a two-year public college in Columbia, South Carolina. Over the course of two weeks, I observed two students to better understand their uses of language. A generational shift in the average college student population is occurring, with millennials graduating and making up less of the college student population. At the same time, Gen Z’s numbers on college campuses continue to grow. Studying how college students use language can provide valuable insights into how to communicate effectively with this population.</para>

      <section id="sect-00011">
      <title>Methods and Participant</title>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00032">I gathered my data using three methods. In the first method, I researched literature about both Midlands Technical College’s student population and communication habits and attitudes among Gen Z students, and I looked into some case studies about the use of emoji. For the second method, I created a group chat consisting of me and two students enrolled in the same section of an introductory psychology course. We used this group chat to discuss the course, assignments, due dates, etc. For the third method, I created a survey of 10 questions asking the students to think about and reflect on how they use language at home versus at school. I then interviewed the students to record their answers. Using this data, I was able to analyze how students use language among their peers versus how they use language around their family.</para>

      <title>Body: Presentation of Data</title>
      <para id="para-00033">The next step in writing your case study is to present your data and analysis. How you set up your body paragraphs is up to you or your instructor. Like the sample study about Leborgne, most case studies are organized into sections and subsections, each devoted to an aspect of the study. You have already written an introduction in which you presented the scope of your study, the participant, the field of research, and other pertinent background information. Now you can continue by organizing each element that you studied into its own section, or you can choose another way of setting it up. For example, your overall structure might look like the structure in <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00141"/>, using your own criteria and as many sections as you need. If you choose another structure, create a similar organizer to help you keep focused as you write.</para>

Include qualitative data based on your observations as well as quantitative data based on measurable results. Be sure to acknowledge what you do not know or were unable to observe. The following example illustrates a typical body paragraph describing a student’s use of capitalization and punctuation in text messages.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00063">Mateo’s use of capitalization and punctuation appeared to change depending on the mood he wanted to convey. For example, “what time do u think prof chang will let us go today”—a casual message about class on Tuesday—lacked capitalization and punctuation (“What time do you think Prof. Chang will let us go today?”). On Thursday, Mateo sent a more formal message regarding the need for the group to study for an upcoming exam: “Guys, we need to settle on a time and place—Oscar’s or Dawson Library—to study.” It’s not clear whether Mateo’s use of capitalization and punctuation is connected to his social group or other factors, as I had limited ability to observe the use of capitalization and punctuation by the study participants.

      <item><term id="term-00002">Bar Charts.</term> These charts typically use vertical bars to compare different data points. They are used primarily to compare similar groups to one another.
      <figure id="fig-00002"><media alt="A bar chart compares and contrasts different data points of the “Seattle Homeless Count 2006-2020”. A bar chart is one type of visual that might be included in a case study.">

      <item><term id="term-00003">Line Graphs.</term> These graphs typically use one or more lines to show how a data point (or points) has changed over time. Line graphs are often used to show trends over a given period.
      <figure id="fig-00003"><media alt="A line graph shows different data points of the “Newzealand’s Total Greenhouse Gas Emission from 1990 Base”. A line graph is one type of visual that might be included in a case study.">

      <item><term id="term-00004">Pie Charts.</term> These charts typically divide a circle (or “pie”) that represents a group into sections that express a percentage of the whole. They are used to show relationships and proportions of these parts.
      <figure id="fig-00004"><media alt="A pie chart shows “Breakout by Vendor”. A pie chart is one type of visual that might be included in a case study.">

      <item><term id="term-00005">Tables.</term> Tables typically break down a set of specific data points that are hard to manage in words or charts. They present data in a linear way to help people locate a specific data point easily.
      <figure id="fig-00005"><media alt="A table contains explanations of titles such as Probably Extinct, Endangered, Decreasing Number, Rare, Uncertain Status, and Rehabilitated and Rehabilitating. A table is one type of visual that might be included in a case study.">

      </list>
      <para id="para-00065">When selecting visuals, ensure that they are clear and related to the topic. A visual’s purpose is to illustrate a point that is too long or complex to express in words. Visuals should have a clear purpose and be clearly labeled. Your audience should be able to interpret and see the point of the visual without explanation. Include visuals to support your work, not simply because you are expected to include them.</para>

      <title>Conclusion: What It All Means</title>
      <para id="para-00066">Once you collect all your data, analyze it further and collectively to form your conclusions. Take a close look again at your interview responses and observation notes. <emphasis effect="italics">What did the participant say in the interview that led to insights about their use of language?</emphasis> Try to identify any words or phrases that tell you something about the participants. See <link document="m00078">Analytical Report: Writing from Facts</link> for more information about analyzing data. <emphasis effect="italics">How does the data from your interviews and observations reveal something that might lead to a generalization about how students use language?</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00067">Arriving at conclusions can be tricky. Base your conclusion on observations of consistent behavior rather than reaching a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. Your conclusion should be something you notice that challenges your previous understanding or assumptions. For example, younger people appear to avoid the “laughing with crying eyes” emoji because it has been so overused that it now seems insincere. Young people are often the driving force behind new uses of language. To replace the “insincere” laughing-with-crying-eyes emoji, many young people turned to the skull emoji to indicate “I’m dead” (from laughing).</para>
      <para id="para-00068">Your conclusion should present your theories. <emphasis effect="italics">Based on the evidence you gathered, what are some generalizations you can make about how students use language? What did you observe that provides opportunity for further study?</emphasis> The example conclusion from a case study on emoji below presents a theory on how students use them.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00069">Overall, I observed that students tend to be more informal when communicating to other students in the same age group. These students used emoji to communicate thoughts and feelings that differed from the more literal and more widely understood meaning of the emoji. I believe that students of this generation want to use language in a way that separates them from their older siblings, parents, and teachers. Thus, their use of emoji reflects that desire as they seek to change the meanings of some emoji. Whether this trend continues as students age is up for debate and presents an opportunity to further understanding of language use within this group.</para>

      <title>Conferencing Electronically</title>
      <para id="para-00070">After you finish your draft, receiving feedback from a peer will help you identify the strengths and weaknesses in your case study. Writers sometimes find it hard to view their work from the perspective of their audience. Therefore, peer feedback will help you focus on your writing in ways that are not obvious to you. Similarly, when you review your peer’s work, react to their draft as a serious and conscientious reader. What suggestions can you offer to make this case study more informative or something you would want to read?</para>
      <para id="para-00071">Technology has facilitated giving and receiving feedback. You are probably familiar with getting feedback during in-class peer reviews and conferences, but if you haven’t done so already, consider electronic peer reviews. Conferencing electronically offers several advantages:</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00010">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Convenience.</emphasis> You don’t have to be in the same room with your conferencing partner to give each other feedback. Within a reasonable time frame, you can review your partner’s writing at a time that is convenient for you.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Time.</emphasis> You have more time to think about your reactions to, and your feedback on, your conferencing partner’s writing than you would in person.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Permanence.</emphasis> The feedback you give and receive is stored digitally and easy to access.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Shareability.</emphasis> Electronic feedback is easier to reproduce and share with others, such as an instructor or a tutor.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00072">Multiple technologies exist to help you conference electronically.</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00011">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Cloud Storage.</emphasis> Cloud storage providers such as Microsoft’s OneDrive and Google Drive store files on the Internet. You can access these sites from any device. Sharing, too, is easier because changes to the document are saved automatically. Therefore, every time you or someone else accesses the document, they are viewing the latest version.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Word Processors.</emphasis> Microsoft Word and Google Docs have review features such as comment boxes and Track Changes as well as the capacity to suggest, accept, and reject changes.</item>

      <para id="para-00073">When you are assigned a partner, open their draft and begin reviewing it. The following tutorial will explain how to use the review features of Microsoft Word.

      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00012">
      <item>Open the document you want to review, and click the Review tab above the tools ribbon.</item>

      <section id="sect-00016">
      <title>Specific Comments</title>
      <para id="para-00074">Provide specific comments when reviewing your peer’s draft. Vague, general comments such as “revise this” don’t explain the reason for revision or how to revise. When conferencing electronically, specificity is even more important because what you write might be the only feedback your peer receives, unless you conference over video chat.</para>
      <para id="para-00075">Comments can generally be categorized as vague, somewhat helpful, and specific and clear.</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00013">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Vague comments</emphasis> might offer praise that doesn’t point to anything specific about the writing, or they might offer criticism without providing a suggested revision or explaining why something should be revised. For example, a comment such as “Revise this sentence” is not helpful. Although it specifically identifies the sentence as needing revision, it doesn’t indicate why or suggest how to revise.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Somewhat helpful comments</emphasis> are still general, but they comment on something specific about the writing. They may also suggest some direction for a revision. For example, a comment such as “Revise this question so that it’s more debatable” identifies the aspect that needs revision and briefly explains why. However, it does not provide further details about why the question is not debatable or how to revise it.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Specific and clear comments</emphasis> identify precisely why the writing is good or needs revision. They also suggest a specific revision or revision strategy the writer can use. For example, “I think this question could be more debatable. ‘Do college students struggle with time management skills?’ is a yes-or-no question and would not lead to a strong argument either way. A better question could be ‘How does lack of time management skills affect college students as a whole?’ or ‘What should be done about students’ lack of time management skills?’”</item>

      <title>Sharing Your Work</title>
      <para id="para-00078">Seek out a student conference or publication to present your case study. Many colleges host events and conferences to showcase student work. Your teacher or advisor can probably direct you toward opportunities to present your work at your college or in the community.</para>
      <para id="para-00079">For example, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">University of Central Oklahoma</term> hosts the annual <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007"><link url="https://openstax.org/r/languageandlinguistic">Language and Linguistics Student Conference</link></term>, which is open to all undergraduate and graduate students. Presenting at a student conference is a great opportunity not only to share your work but also to network and gain experience that will make you stand out when applying to other schools, for scholarships, and for jobs.</para>
      <para id="para-00080">In addition, a number of academic journals publish student research. For instance, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/spectrum"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Spectrum</term></link>, sponsored by the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">University of Alberta</term>, is a student-run interdisciplinary journal that showcases students’ work. See more undergraduate publishing opportunities provided by the Council on <link url="https://openstax.org/r/ugjournalslisting">Undergraduate Research</link>.</para>
      <para id="para-00081">If you publish or present your case study, remember to adhere to ethical standards. As explained in <link document="m00137">Tracing a Broad Issue in the Individual</link>, many universities and professional organizations will provide guidance on what standards to follow when conducting a case study. Be sure to review these guidelines with the organization sponsoring the conference or publication.</para>
      <para id="para-00082">Another option for sharing is to gather the case studies done by all class members and, with the approval of your instructor, go through them to ascertain what, if any, trends emerge. If you and your classmates think these studies might be useful to college administrators, consider sending them, along with a detailed cover letter, to the Office of Admissions, the Dean of Students, or another appropriate administrative office.</para>
