      <para id="para-00002"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Profile writing</term> are articles or essays in which the writer focuses on a specific trait or behavior that reveals something essential about the subject. Much profile material comes from interviews either with the subject or with people who know about the subject. However, interviews may not always be part of a profile, for profile writers also draw on other sources of information. In creating profiles, writers usually combine the techniques of narrative, or storytelling, and reporting, or including information that answers the questions of <emphasis effect="italics">who</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">what</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">when</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">where</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">why</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">how</emphasis>.</para>

      <title>Potential Profile Subjects and Angles</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00003">You can find profile subjects everywhere. The purpose of a profile is to give readers an insight into something fundamental about the subject, whether that subject is a person, a social group, a building, a piece of art, a public space, or a cultural tradition. Writers of profiles often conduct several types of research, including interviews and <term id="term-00004">field observations</term>, as well as consult related published sources. A profile usually reveals one aspect of the subject to the audience; this focus is called an <term id="term-00005">angle</term>. To decide which angle to take, profile writers look for patterns in their research, then consider their audience when making choices about both the angle and the <term id="term-00006">tone</term>, or attitude toward the subject.</para>
