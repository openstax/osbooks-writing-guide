    <para id="para-00002">In this section, you will combine what you learned earlier about reflecting on and analyzing images with another way of writing about images: writing persuasively, or persuading. Like reflecting and analyzing, writing persuasively requires clear, vivid descriptions of the technical aspects of an artwork, such as point of view, arrangement, color, and symbolism, as explained in <link document="m00159">Glance at Genre: Relationship Between Image and Rhetoric</link>. Remember that reflecting on an image helps you make sense of both the image and your experience from different perspectives. Reading other people’s reflections expands your universe of experience. Analyzing images improves your critical thinking skills by synthesizing description, reflection, and logical thinking to determine what an image’s design elements mean. You write persuasively about images when you determine that an image’s meaning has or does not have a value (that you define) for its viewers. For example, Leo Davis, in his analysis of <emphasis effect="italics">Dancing Sailors</emphasis> in <link document="m00160">Annotated Student Sample</link>, determines the homoerotic message in the image and the painter’s tone or attitude toward his subject. You can also extend the scope of persuasion to make a recommendation about the status or merit of the work, as you will do in this assignment.</para>
    <section id="sect-00002">
    <title>Writing Persuasively about Images</title>
    <para id="para-00003">Like reflection, persuasion starts with context and description and can include personal reflections. The difference is primarily in the purpose and often the tone, or attitude toward the subject and audience. The purpose generally falls into one of three categories:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">What is the image’s value?</emphasis></emphasis> In the art world, these discussions are commonplace. Major publications such as the <emphasis effect="italics">New Yorker</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">Harper’s Magazine</emphasis> publish reviews of artists, galleries, and exhibitions. Critics and scholars argue that such discussions serve to establish a society’s values and to benchmark the limits of what a society will and will not tolerate. Certainly, 2020 witnessed an explosion of such conversations. Protestors created images meant for display on public property, many of which were identified as graffiti or acts of vandalism; streets and other locations were renamed to reflect a growing awareness of the role that Black excellence has played in America’s history; and monuments and memorials relating to injustice were reevaluated, vandalized, and removed.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">What happened?</emphasis></emphasis> Forensic arguments often relate to legal situations, in which lawyers, judges, and juries try to determine what happened and how to respond. In the case of images, these techniques are applied to assess the circumstances of an image’s creation as well as its critical and modern reception.</item>
    <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">What should happen?</emphasis></emphasis> In the public sector, officials decide whether to fund artistic works. In the private sector, companies decide on images that faithfully represent their brands and values.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00004">In persuasive writing, the purpose is usually revealed in a <term id="term-00001">thesis statement</term>, a single sentence, sometimes two, that defines the author’s position and gives one or more reasons for it. The thesis usually appears at the end of the introduction, although it can occur at the start of either the introduction or the conclusion.</para>

    <title>Summary of Assignment: Writing Persuasively about an Image</title>
    <para id="para-00008">Public works projects such as stadiums or convention centers, private developments such as condominiums and shopping centers, and online spaces such as websites and social media platforms all commission artists to create exclusive works for display. These works are intended to reflect the vision of the artist as well as to promote the brand or mission of the space. Imagine that you have been asked to analyze an artist’s work to determine whether the artist should contribute to the development of a local space that you select. Select the work of an artist, either <link url="https://openstax.org/r/Sara.Ludy">Sara Ludy</link> or another artist whose work is familiar to you or whose work you would like to learn more about. See <link target-id="sect-00003" document="m00165">Further Resources</link> at the end of this chapter for suggested museums to visit in person or online. You can choose from historical figures or living artists. You can even choose an artist who illustrated a graphic novel you have read. Once you have chosen an artist and an image created by that artist, identify the aspects of the work you wish to assess, and support your analysis with technical descriptions of the image. Then, explain why you reached your decision about the artist’s contribution to the selected space.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">The parts in this section will take you through the development of a sample essay, using the example of American sculptor James Earle <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Fraser</term>’s (1876–1953) <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003"><emphasis effect="italics">Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt</emphasis></term>. As you follow along in this process, consider how it applies to your topic. Think of the process as divided into these six steps:</para>
    <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00005">
    <item>Identify the rhetorical situation.</item>
    <item>Outline the elements you intend to analyze.</item>
    <item>Write an introduction in which you frame the image and the context in which you intend to discuss it.</item>
    <item>As you draft, or before you draft the body of the essay, write topic sentences to identify the focus of each paragraph on a specific technical or contextual aspect of the image.</item>
    <item>Build your paragraphs by describing the relevant elements.</item>
    <item>Conclude by suggesting directions to consider in the future.</item>
    </list>
    <para class="annotation visual-icon linguistic-icon" id="para-00010"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens 1.</emphasis></emphasis> Visit <link url="https://openstax.org/r/Sara.Ludy">Sara Ludy’s website</link> and select an image, a rendering, or an animation that speaks to you in some way, and identify the technical aspects you wish to assess. Support your analysis with descriptions of the image, using the vocabulary introduced in <link document="m00157">“Reading” Images</link> and <link document="m00159">Glance at Genre: Relationship Between Image and Rhetoric</link>. Then, as an option, consider whether or not you would advise an individual to purchase the work or how you would advise an organization to use it (or not use it) as a representative image—for example, as part of a logo or cover for a publication.</para>
    <para class="annotation visual-icon linguistic-icon" id="para-00011"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens 2.</emphasis></emphasis> Another option for assessing an artist’s work is to compare and contrast this work with another piece, either by Sara Ludy or by a different artist. In doing so, you may consider ways in which the artist and their work have changed over time, or you may consider the influence one artist has on another. Finally, you may consider the images in different contexts through the lens of the artists’ experiences, places in history, personal identities, and artistic practices.</para>
    <para class="annotation visual-icon linguistic-icon speech-icon" id="para-00012"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens 3.</emphasis></emphasis> Consider a work from a multimodal perspective. If you are interested in the connections of art and culture, consider choosing a piece of historic or contemporary Native American art. You can find information and view images at the websites for the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/National">National Museum of the American Indian</link> and the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/Hearts-of-Our"><emphasis effect="italics">Hearts of Our People: Native Women Artists</emphasis></link> exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Create an <term id="term-00004">infographic</term> or a short video assessing the chosen artwork. An infographic incorporates multiple images and texts into a single image that can be read and understood quickly. A short video could work in a similar way, but the images would be presented sequentially with narration, either spoken or written. Your multimodal work should consider the elements of visual rhetoric discussed throughout this chapter and combine reflection with analysis and persuasion. See <link document="m00001">Multimodal and Online Writing: Creative Interaction between Text and Image</link> for more information on creating a multimodal work.</para>

In the case of the Roosevelt statue, the author has thought about which technical elements of the statue to analyze. The author also has considered the important aspects of the historical context shaping Theodore Roosevelt’s life, presidency, and legacy; the museum and the cultural events in the year the statue was erected; and the cultural events in the year the decision is being made about whether to remove the statue.

    <title>Write an Introduction</title>
    <para id="para-00021">In your introduction, name the artist, the image, and the context in which you intend to discuss it. See the suggestions above for research you may need to do regarding context. If you do research, remember to cite the sources you use because this information did not originate with you. The context may consist of one or two paragraphs, depending on how much information your audience needs to understand your analysis. (This is one reason to have a good understanding of your audience.) This type of introduction appears frequently in visual analyses and persuasive papers.</para>
    <para id="para-00022">The two keys to writing a strong context are (1) being selective about what you include and (2) framing your own analysis. For example, Theodore Roosevelt is an important historical figure, and many books have been written about him. Even two paragraphs are insufficient to summarize every relevant detail about him. Likewise, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">American Museum of Natural History</term> plays a significant role in documenting mammalian life and has a vital, if at times controversial, role in American scientific history. In the two paragraphs below, the author selects details about the president, the museum, and the statue that both highlight the reasons they are admired and touch on their potential failings. These details are not all-inclusive; they are carefully culled from all of the available information to lead up to the subsequent analysis, which focuses on the reasons to remove the statue. The last sentence in the second paragraph is the thesis, in which the author states her agreement with the museum’s decision.</para>

    <title>Contextual Introduction</title>
    <quote id="quote-00001">
    <para class="student-sample" id="para-00023">Theodore Roosevelt cultivated a hearty outdoor lifestyle, exploring the Dakota Territory in the 1890s, serving as a Rough Rider during the Spanish-American War (1898), and advocating for the conservation of America’s natural resources. Despite criticism for the way in which he acquired the land and rights to construct the Panama Canal, he was widely respected both at home and abroad, being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (1906) for helping negotiate a peace treaty between Japan and Russia. After his presidency, he traveled extensively throughout Africa and South America, where he killed many animals and returned them to serve as specimens in America’s natural history museums. He was himself shot while campaigning, but as the bullet did not penetrate his lung, he gave his speech regardless, earning him the reputation of a bull moose.</para>
    <para class="student-sample" id="para-00024">A statue commemorating Roosevelt was presented to the public in 1940, two decades after his death, and placed in front of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where Roosevelt served as governor from 1899 to 1900. On one side of Roosevelt, depicted on horseback at the center of the sculpture, walks an African person, and on the other an Indigenous person. All three figures have a straight, proud posture and look directly ahead of them, toward the future. Given its placement, the statue is likely intended as an allegory, depicting the men of two continents—Africa and North America, including its Indigenous people—on a voyage of discovery and learning. Over time, however, and given the hierarchical framing of the image, with the White man clothed in a suit and atop a horse, central to the image, the statue’s meaning has changed, leading to the praiseworthy and long-awaited decision to remove it in 2020.</para>

    <title>Build Body Paragraphs</title>
    <para id="para-00026">Support each topic sentence by describing in detail the elements you have chosen to assess. When describing the image, avoid overuse of adjectives and adverbs. Use concrete rather than abstract nouns. Abstract nouns name ideas, such as <emphasis effect="italics">perspective</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">theme</emphasis>; concrete nouns refer to specific, tangible elements, such as <emphasis effect="italics">triangle</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">line</emphasis>, or <emphasis effect="italics">granite</emphasis>. Incorporate strong verbs as well as the necessary forms of <emphasis effect="italics">to be</emphasis> (<emphasis effect="italics">is</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">are</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">was</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">were</emphasis>). Think about what the features in the image are <emphasis effect="italics">doing—</emphasis>the ways they interact with one another, the space around them, and the viewer’s relationship to them. Finally, avoid speculation while going beyond description. Keep the discussion rooted in the evidence, and show readers what the evidence points to, what it means.</para>

    <title>Sample Body Paragraph: Arrangement</title>
    <quote id="quote-00002">
    <para class="student-sample" id="para-00027">The sculpture’s three human figures are arranged in a triangle, suggesting an apex with two supporting angles. President Roosevelt is by far the tallest of the three and always visible from whichever angle the viewer faces the sculpture. Meanwhile, the two flanking figures can be seen fully only from the front or the back, suggesting that they lack nuance or subtlety because they can be seen and understood only directly. When seen from an angle, they are either overshadowed by the White man on horseback or disappear from view. Similarly, level with the Native American and the African is the horse, all three depicted with sharply defined muscles, highlighting their strength. Roosevelt is similarly well defined but fully clothed and towering over both the animal and the two men. Overall, the sculpture suggests, at the very least, a hierarchy among the three men and, at worst, a dominance of the White man over those of color.</para>

    <title>Formulate a Conclusion</title>
    <para id="para-00028">After you have developed the body paragraphs in which you analyze and reflect on the image, conclude by expanding on your thesis and suggesting directions to consider in the future. One important role of the conclusion is to further the discourse by showing how this rhetorical moment is merely one example of other such discourses and how they can be used productively in other contexts. In this case, an effective strategy would be to outline criteria for memorials of historical figures, even those with complicated legacies and flaws.</para>

    <para id="para-00030">After you have drafted your paper, you are ready to review the work of your peers while they review your work. Keep in mind that you and your peers are almost certainly going to respond to images differently. This is the value of critical discourse about visual rhetoric: pooling shared responses and experiences helps develop a greater understanding of the human condition. As you review your peers’ writing, part of your task is to separate your personal responses from the writer’s analysis of the image’s technical elements.</para>

    <title>Hone Your Practice</title>
    <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00032">Writing the first draft is hard work, and you are right to feel pride and a sense of accomplishment after completing it. Thus, any critique can feel unjust and even personally wounding. Remember, though, that writing is a process and that everyone is an apprentice, working toward expertise and, eventually, mastery. So take every opportunity you can to learn from others and hone your skills.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">First, reward yourself for completing the first draft. You may choose to take a long walk, prepare a favorite meal, or enjoy some leisure time with friends. Savor the moment. Time away from the writing process is time for your writing and thinking muscles to recover. Consider some light reading. Think about it this way—you’ll never build muscle if you go to the gym all day while you starve yourself. In the same way, you’ve expended a lot of vocabulary and sentence- structure energy. Feed it to rebuild it.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">Finally, return to your work with a goal in mind and a plan to put it into place. Look at the feedback you received. <emphasis effect="italics">Does your work require major revision or minor tweaks?</emphasis> If the latter, then your task is simple: make a to-do list and get started!
