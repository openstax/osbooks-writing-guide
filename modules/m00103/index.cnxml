      </list>
      </section>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00002">Now is the time to try your hand at writing a position argument. Your instructor may provide some possible topics or a singular topic. If your instructor allows you to choose your own topic, consider a general subject you feel strongly about and whether you can provide enough support to develop that subject into an essay. For instance, suppose you think about a general subject such as “adulting.” In looking back at what you have learned while becoming an adult, you think of what you wish you had known during your early teenage years. These thoughts might lead you to brainstorm about details of the effects of money in your life or your friends’ lives. In reviewing your brainstorming, you might zero in on one topic you feel strongly about and think it provides enough depth to develop into a position argument. Suppose your brainstorming leads you to think about negative financial concerns you or some of your friends have encountered. Thinking about what could have helped address those concerns, you decide that a mandated high school course in financial literacy would have been useful. This idea might lead you to formulate your <term id="term-00001">working thesis statement</term>—first draft of your thesis statement—like this: <emphasis effect="italics">To help students learn how to make sensible financial decisions, a mandatory class in financial literacy should be offered in high schools throughout the country.</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00003">Once you decide on a topic and begin moving through the writing process, you may need to fine-tune or even change the topic and rework your initial idea. This fine-tuning may come as you brainstorm, later when you begin drafting, or after you have completed a draft and submitted it to your peers for constructive criticism. These possibilities occur because the writing process is <term id="term-00002">recursive</term>—that is, it moves back and forth almost simultaneously and maybe even haphazardly at times, from planning to revising to editing to drafting, back to planning, and so on.</para>

      <title>Summary of Assignment</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon culture-icon" id="para-00004">Write a position argument on a controversial issue that you choose or that your instructor assigns to you. If you are free to choose your own topic, consider one of the following:</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
      <item>The legal system would be strengthened if ______________________.</item>
      <item>The growing use of technology in college classrooms is weakening _____________.</item>

      <item>Segments of American cultures have differing rules of acceptable grammar, so in a college classroom ___________________.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00005">In addition, if you have the opportunity to choose your own topic and wish to search further, take the lead from trailblazer <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Charles Blow</term> and look to media for newsworthy “trends.” Find a controversial issue that affects you or people you know, and take a position on it. As you craft your argument, identify a position opposing yours, and then refute it with reasoning and evidence. Be sure to gather information on the issue so that you can support your position sensibly with well-developed ideas and evidence.</para>
      <para class="annotation culture-icon dreaming-icon" id="para-00006"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italic">Another Lens.</emphasis></emphasis> To gain a different perspective on your issue, consider again the people affected by it. Your position probably affects different people in different ways. For example, if you are writing that the minimum wage should be raised, then you might easily view the issue through the lens of minimum-wage workers, especially those who struggle to make ends meet. However, if you look at the issue through the lens of those who employ minimum-wage workers, your viewpoint might change. Depending on your topic and thesis, you may need to use print or online sources to gain insight into different perspectives.</para>
      <para id="para-00007">For additional information about minimum-wage workers, you could consult</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
      <item>printed material available in your college library;</item>
      <item>databases in your college library; and</item>
      <item>online sources. For instance, you could use a search engine to find details about
      <list list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="open-circle" id="list-00004">
      <item>pros and cons of raising the minimum wage;</item>
      <item>what happens after the minimum wage is raised;</item>
      <item>how to live on a minimum-wage salary;</item>
      <item>how a raise in minimum wage is funded; and</item>
      <item>minimum wage in various U.S. states.</item>
      </list></item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00008">To gain more insight about your topic, adopt a stance that opposes your original position and brainstorm ideas from that viewpoint. Begin by gathering evidence that would help you refute your previous stance and appeal to your audience.</para>

      <section class="quick-launch" id="sect-00003">
      <title>Working Thesis Frames and Organization of Ideas</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon linguistic-icon" id="para-00009">After you have decided on your topic, the next step is to arrive at your working thesis. You probably have a good idea of the direction your working thesis will take. That is, you know where you stand on the issue or problem, but you are not quite sure of how to word your stance to share it with readers. At this point, then, use brainstorming to think critically about your position and to discover the best way to phrase your statement.</para>
      <para id="para-00010">For example, after reading an article discussing different state-funded community college programs, one student thought that a similar program was needed in Alabama, her state. However, she was not sure how the program worked. To begin, she composed and answered <term id="term-00004">“reporters’ questions”</term> such as these:</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">What</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">does a state-funded community college program do?</emphasis> pays for part or all of the tuition of a two-year college student</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">Who</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">qualifies for the program?</emphasis> high school graduates and GED holders</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">Who</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">benefits from this?</emphasis> students needing financial assistance, employers, and Alabama residents</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">Why</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">is this needed?</emphasis> some can’t afford to go to college; tuition goes up every year; colleges would be more diverse if everyone who wanted to go could afford to go</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">Where</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">would the program be available?</emphasis> at all public community colleges</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">When</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">could someone apply for the program?</emphasis> any time</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">How</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">can the state fund this</emphasis>? use lottery income, like other states</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00011">The student then reviewed her responses, altered her original idea to include funding through a lottery, and composed this working thesis:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00012"><emphasis effect="italics">To provide equal educational opportunities for all residents, the state of Alabama should create a lottery to completely fund tuition at community colleges.</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00013">Remember that a strong thesis for a position should</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00006">
      <item>state your stance on a debatable issue;</item>
      <item>reflect your purpose of persuasion; and</item>
      <item>be based on your opinion or observation.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00014">When you first consider your topic for an argumentative work, think about the reasoning for your position and the evidence you will need—that is, think about the “because” part of your argument. For instance, if you want to argue that your college should provide free Wi-Fi for every student, extend your stance to include “because” and then develop your reasoning and evidence. In that case, your argument might read like this: <emphasis effect="italics">Ervin Community College should provide free Wi-Fi for all students because students may not have Internet access at home.</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00015">Note that the “because” part of your argument may come at the beginning or the end and may be implied in your wording.</para>
      <para id="para-00016">As you develop your thesis, you may need help funneling all of your ideas. Return to the possibilities you have in mind, and select the ideas that you think are strongest, that recur most often, or that you have the most to say about. Then use those ideas to fill in one of the following sentence frames to develop your working thesis. Feel free to alter the frame as necessary to fit your position. While there is no limit to the frames that are possible, these may help get you started.</para>
      <para id="para-00017">________________ is caused/is not caused by ________________, and _____________ should be done.</para>
      <para id="para-00018"><emphasis effect="bold">Example:</emphasis> A declining enrollment rate in college is caused by high tuition rates, and an immediate freeze on the cost of tuition should be applied.</para>
      <para id="para-00019">______________ should/should not be allowed (to) ________________ for a number of reasons.</para>
      <para id="para-00020"><emphasis effect="bold">Example:</emphasis> People who do not wear masks during a pandemic should not be allowed to enter public buildings for a number of reasons.</para>
      <para id="para-00021">Because (of) ________________, ___________________ will happen/continue to happen.</para>
      <para id="para-00022"><emphasis effect="bold">Example:</emphasis> Because of a lack of emphasis on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics) education in public schools, America will continue to lag behind many other countries.</para>
      <para id="para-00023">_____________ is similar to/nothing like ________________ because ______________.</para>
      <para id="para-00024"><emphasis effect="bold">Example:</emphasis> College classes are nothing like high school classes because in college, more responsibility is on the student, the classes are less frequent but more intense, and the work outside class takes more time to complete.</para>
      <para id="para-00025">______________ can be/cannot be thought of as __________________ because ______________.</para>
      <para id="para-00026"><emphasis effect="bold">Example:</emphasis> The Black Lives Matter movement can be thought of as an extension of the Civil Rights movement from the 1950s and 1960s because it shares the same mission of fighting racism and ending violence against Black people.</para>
      <para id="para-00027">Next, consider the details you will need to support your thesis. The Aristotelian argument structure, named for the Greek philosopher <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Aristotle</term>, is one that may help you frame the draft of your position argument. For this method, use something like the following chart. In Writing Process: Creating a Position Argument, you will find a similar organizer that you can copy and use for your assignment.</para>
      <figure id="fig-00002"><media alt="A flow chart titled “Using the Aristotelian Argument for Organization” connects rectangles of the same size via arrows. The ten rectangular boxes read, “ Introduce the issue or subject and your overall position.”; “Present your working thesis statement (your focused position).”; “Give the background of the issue or subject.”; “Explain the significance of the issue, whom it affects, and how it affects them.”; “Discuss an opposing stance or position.”; “Refute that position’s argument.”; “Provide logical evidence.”; “Analyze evidence that fairly illustrates the issue and clearly supports your position in the argument.”; “Remind readers of your position and why it is important to them.” ; and “Conclude your position argument with a call to action: a statement of what you want readers to do.”">

      <title>Rhetorical Appeals and Types of Supporting Evidence</title>

      <title>Using Logic</title>
      <para id="para-00049">In a position argument, the appropriate use of <term id="term-00029">logic</term> is especially important for readers to trust what you write. It is also important to look for logic in material you read and possibly cite in your paper so that you can determine whether writers’ claims are reasonable. Two main categories of logical thought are <term id="term-00030">inductive reasoning</term> and <term id="term-00031">deductive reasoning</term>.</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00011">
      <item><term id="term-00032">Inductive reasoning</term> moves from specific to broad ideas. You begin by collecting details, observations, incidents, or facts; examining them; and drawing a conclusion from them. Suppose, for example, you are writing about attendance in college classes. For three weeks, you note the attendance numbers in all your Monday, Wednesday, and Friday classes (specific details), and you note that attendance is lower on Friday than on the other days (a specific detail). From these observations, you determine that many students prefer not to attend classes on Fridays (your conclusion).</item>
      <item><term id="term-00033">Deductive reasoning</term> moves from general to specific ideas. You begin with a <term id="term-00034">hypothesis</term> or <term id="term-00035">premise</term>, a general concept, and then examine possibilities that would lead to a specific and logical conclusion. For instance, suppose you think that opportunities for foreign students at your college are inadequate (general concept). You examine the specific parts of that concept (e.g., whether your college provides multicultural clubs, help with language skills, or work-study opportunities) and determine that those opportunities are not available. You then determine that opportunities for foreign students are lacking at your college.</item>

      <title>Logical Fallacies and Propaganda</title>
      <para id="para-00050"><term id="term-00036">Fallacies</term> are mistakes in logic. Readers and writers should be aware of these when they creep into writing, indicating that the points the writers make may not be valid. Two common fallacies are hasty generalizations and circular arguments. See <link document="m00091">Glance at Genre: Rhetorical Strategies</link> for more on logical fallacies.</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00012">
      <item>A <term id="term-00037">hasty generalization</term>is a conclusion based on either inadequate or biased evidence. Consider this statement: “Two students in Math 103 were nervous before their recent test; therefore, all students in that class must have text anxiety.” This is a hasty generalization because the second part of the statement (the generalization about all students in the class) is inadequate to support what the writer noted about only two students.</item>
      <item>A <term id="term-00038">circular argument</term> is one that merely restates what has already been said. Consider this statement: “<emphasis effect="italics">The Hate U Give</emphasis> is a well-written book because <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00039">Angie Thomas</term>, its author, is a good novelist.” The statement that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00040">Thomas</term> is a good novelist does not explain why her book is well written.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00051">In addition to checking work for fallacies, consider <term id="term-00041">propaganda</term>, information worded so that it endorses a particular viewpoint, often of a political nature. Two common types of propaganda are <term id="term-00042">bandwagon</term> and <term id="term-00043">fear</term>.</para>
      <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00013">
      <item>In getting on the <term id="term-00044">bandwagon</term>, the writer encourages readers to conform to a popular trend and endorse an opinion, a movement, or a person because everyone else is doing so. Consider this statement: “Everyone is behind the idea that 7 a.m. classes are too early and should be changed to at least 8 a.m. Shouldn’t you endorse this sensible idea, too?”</item>
      <item>In using <term id="term-00045">fear</term>, the writer presents a dire situation, usually followed by what could be done to prevent it. Consider this statement: “Our country is at a turning point. Enemies threaten us with their power, and our democracy is at risk of being crushed. The government needs a change, and Paul Windhaus is just the man to see we get that change.” This quotation appeals to fear about the future of the country and implies that electing a certain individual will solve the predicted problems.</item>

      <item><para id="para-00057"><emphasis effect="bold">Introduce the issue and assert your thesis.</emphasis> Make sure the issue has at least two debatable sides. Your thesis establishes the position from which you will argue. Writers often state their thesis as the last sentence in the first paragraph, as the student writer has done:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00058">The problem of mental health has become front-page news in the last two months. <emphasis effect="italics">Hill’s Herald</emphasis>, Powell College South’s newspaper, reported 14 separate incidents of students who sought counseling but could not get appointments with college staff. <emphasis effect="highlight">Since mental health problems are widespread among the student population, the college should hire more health care workers to address this problem.</emphasis></para></item>
      <item><para id="para-00059"><emphasis effect="bold">Summarize the counterclaims<emphasis effect="italics">.</emphasis></emphasis> Before elaborating on your claims, explain the opposition’s claims. Including this information at the beginning gives your argument something to focus on—and refute—throughout the paper. If you ignore counterclaims, your argument may appear incomplete, and readers may think you have not researched your topic sufficiently. When addressing a counterclaim, state it clearly, show empathy for those who have that view, and then immediately refute it with support developed through reasoning and evidence. Squeezing the counterclaims between the thesis and the evidence reserves the strongest places—the opening and closing—for your position.</para>

The writer plans to use a problem-solution reasoning strategy to elaborate on these three points using these pieces of evidence:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00065">Point 1: Wait times are too long.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00066">Kay Payne, one of the campus counselors, states that the wait time for an appointment with her is approximately 10 days.</para>

The recent news articles that attest to their not being able to schedule appointments add to the alarm.

      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00079">While office space is available in Pennington Hall, that location is far from ideal. It is in a wooded area of campus, six blocks from the nearest dorm. Students who would go there might be afraid to walk through the woods or might be afraid to walk that distance. The location might deter them from making appointments.</para></item>
      <item><para id="para-00080"><emphasis effect="bold">Now give the best reasoning and evidence to support your position.</emphasis> Because this is a delayed-thesis organization, readers are still unsure of your stance. This section should be the longest and most carefully documented part of the paper. After summarizing and refuting claims, the writer then elaborates on these three points using problem-solution reasoning supported by this evidence as discussed in Reasoning Strategies: Improving Critical Thinking, implying her position before moving to the conclusion, where she states her thesis.</para>

      <title>Responding to Counterclaims</title>
      <para id="para-00149">The more complex the issue, the more opposing sides it may have. For example, a writer whose position is that Powell College South Campus should offer daycare to its students with children might find opposition for different reasons. Someone may oppose the idea out of concern for cost; someone else may support the idea if the daycare is run on a volunteer basis; someone else may support the idea if the services are offered off campus.</para>
      <para id="para-00150">As you revise, continue studying your peer reviewer’s comments about counterclaims. If you agree with any counterclaim, then say so in the paragraph in which you address counterclaims. This agreement will further establish your credibility by showing your fairness and concern for the issue. Look over your paper and peer review comments, and then consider these questions:</para>

      <item>In what ways do you address realistic counterclaims? What other counterclaims should you address? Should you add to or replace current counterclaims?</item>

      <item>Are there any counterclaims with which you agree? If so, how do you concede to them in your paper? In what ways does your discussion show fairness?</item>
