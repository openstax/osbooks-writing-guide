    <title>Summary of Assignment: Rhetorical Analysis</title>
    <para id="para-00003">The assignment is to write a rhetorical analysis of a piece of persuasive writing. It can be an editorial, a movie or book review, an essay, a chapter in a book, or a letter to the editor. For your rhetorical analysis, you will need to consider the rhetorical situation—subject, author, purpose, context, audience, and culture—and the strategies the author uses in creating the argument. Back up all your claims with evidence from the text. In preparing your analysis, consider these questions:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item>What is the subject? Be sure to distinguish what the piece is about.</item>
    <item>Who is the writer, and what do you know about them? Be sure you know whether the writer is considered objective or has a particular agenda.</item>
    <item>Who are the readers? What do you know or what can you find out about them as the particular audience to be addressed at this moment?</item>
    <item>What is the purpose or aim of this work? What does the author hope to achieve?</item>
    <item>What are the time/space/place considerations and influences of the writer? What can you know about the writer and the full context in which they are writing?</item>
    <item>What specific techniques has the writer used to make their points? Are these techniques successful, unsuccessful, or questionable?</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00004">For this assignment, read the following opinion piece by Octavio Peterson, printed in his local newspaper. You may choose it as the text you will analyze, continuing the analysis on your own, or you may refer to it as a sample as you work on another text of your choosing. Your instructor may suggest presidential or other political speeches, which make good subjects for rhetorical analysis.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">When you have read the piece by Peterson advocating for the need to continue teaching foreign languages in schools, reflect carefully on the impact the letter has had on you. You are not expected to agree or disagree with it. Instead, focus on the rhetoric—the way Peterson uses language to make his point and convince you of the validity of his argument.</para>
    <para class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00006"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens.</emphasis></emphasis> Consider presenting your rhetorical analysis in a multimodal format. Use a blogging site or platform such as WordPress or Tumblr to explore the blogging genre, which includes video clips, images, hyperlinks, and other media to further your discussion. Because this genre is less formal than written text, your tone can be conversational. However, you still will be required to provide the same kind of analysis that you would in a traditional essay. The same materials will be at your disposal for making appeals to persuade your readers. Rhetorical analysis in a blog may be a new forum for the exchange of ideas that retains the basics of more formal communication. When you have completed your work, share it with a small group or the rest of the class. See Multimodal and Online Writing: Creative Interaction between Text and Image for more about creating a multimodal composition.</para>

    <title>GREENDALE DAILY COURIER</title>
    <para id="para-00007">READERS’ VIEWS</para>
    <para id="para-00008">I am writing as both a concerned parent and a citizen in response to the recently announced Board of Managers forum to be held at City Hall on allocation of resources for education. Among the items for discussion is the likelihood that budget cuts for next year will result in the curtailment of foreign-language instruction—a move that needs serious consideration.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">I’ve spent most of my life in Greendale and graduated from elementary and high school before going to Westover State for my engineering degree. For 18 years, I’ve worked in Greendale city management, and my children are in school here. I have always supported the heroic efforts of teachers and administrators in making our schools as fine as they have come to be, and I have tried to keep myself informed about school policies. Now, however, as an active and loyal member of this community, I am alarmed by the announcement that an integral part of the curriculum is under financial strain and might vanish like a puff of smoke. Once gone, soon forgotten—to the detriment of all of us.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">What am I referring to, you ask? Look at the middle of page 4 in the recent publication of plans for a revised city budget: Some know-nothing, who dares not be identified, has stated that all foreign-language instruction may be stopped in the next school year. This very “unimportant” item, which another coward has sought to bury conveniently, actually counts for a lot with me, counts with many others, and should count a lot for you as well. Indeed, this looming catastrophe could actually be a great opportunity to <emphasis effect="italics">reinforce</emphasis>—not <emphasis effect="italics">reduce</emphasis>—a commitment that needs <emphasis effect="italics">renewing</emphasis>, not canceling! Rather than end it, we must continue it. Rather than curtail it, we must make it as strong as neighboring school districts are doing. If we don’t, we will be the only district without it. Do we want our children left with an educational disadvantage? Do we want property values and tax revenue to plummet as parents flee from an inferior school district?</para>
    <para id="para-00011">Folks may think I’m just talking off the top of my head, but I’ve done some reading around to see what other states have going on. And what I see isn’t good. Not good at all, in fact. Only 20% of K–12 students nationwide study a foreign language. We, however, have enjoyed the benefits of learning for so long because we are ranked among the “nation’s finest” as far as educational opportunity. And that’s a reason a lot of us live here.</para>
    <para id="para-00012">Yet if the rest of the country trails us—and that is shameful, but nothing we can do about it—the rest of the world does not! Indeed, some countries in Europe have 100% of their elementary and secondary school students learning a second language, and many do a third! English is most often what they choose to learn. And in the good ol’ U.S., over 10% of K–12 students are actually learning English as a second language while speaking another at home, all the way from California with almost 20% to West Virginia with less than 1%! This statistic proves that kids learn easily, and in fact it gives them a competitive edge over the other 80% of American kids who won’t know a word of anything but English.</para>
    <para id="para-00013">All over Europe, all over Asia, all over Africa and South America, millions of people know and use English. It has become an international language of commerce, travel, entertainment, and politics. They can communicate with us as well as they communicate in their first languages. That may be very convenient because we think we don’t have to learn another language. But think about it: We are at a DIS-advantage here both in everyday communication and in business negotiations. We need to understand how business is done overseas, how people of other nationalities think and act, and be able to do that without relying on interpreters. Indeed, knowing another person’s language is a great advantage, for you can understand what the interpreter doesn’t translate.</para>
    <para id="para-00014">Knowing only one language isolates us culturally and gives the impression we don’t give a hang, that we are OK with being know-nothings and are somehow better than other people. Don’t we care about that?</para>
    <para id="para-00015">And forget business for a minute. In a global society, people will need to communicate in languages other than English. My sister is a doctor who uses Spanish every day in her work as she deals with patients in life-threatening situations. Fortunately, she has the skill of speaking another language. Whether we’re doctors or anything else, at some point we will face a situation in which knowing another language will be helpful or even crucial.</para>
    <para id="para-00016">Is ignorance and arrogance the impression we want to give others? We can do much better! I know budgets are limited by state cutbacks, and tough decisions must be made about how to allocate tax dollars. But for so long we have offered students something. Sure, some students are sitting at home secretly rejoicing in a watered-down curriculum that will free up some extra time for texting and hanging out. Sure, some dislike having to learn Spanish or Chinese and have never seen the need for it. But just like lots of things in life, we know it’s “good for us” in the long run, don’t we? I do know that some colleges have done away with foreign-language requirements for their own reasons, and many residents here and elsewhere think that is the road to travel now for financial reasons.</para>
    <para id="para-00017">But I think just the opposite: we are shortchanging our future leaders, our city, our state, our country, and our place in the world if we shrink our horizons, pull in our horns, and build in narrow perspectives.</para>
    <para id="para-00018">Please, won’t you stand with me on this, as so many others already have, to use our resources in the best ways? Let’s not allow our children to lag behind our neighbors here and abroad, for without knowledge and the ability to communicate, we are doomed.</para>

    <title>Start with a Thesis Statement</title>
    <para class="annotation dreaming-icon linguistic-icon" id="para-00022">After you have read this opinion piece, or another of your choice, several times and have a clear understanding of it as a piece of rhetoric, consider whether the writer has succeeded in being persuasive. You might find that in some ways they have and in others they have not. Then, with a clear understanding of your purpose—to analyze how the writer seeks to persuade—you can start framing a <term id="term-00001">thesis statement</term>: a declarative sentence that states the topic, the angle you are taking, and the aspects of the topic the rest of the paper will support.</para>
    <para id="para-00023">Complete the following sentence frames as you prepare to start:</para>

    <section class="drafting" id="sect-00005">
    <title>Text Evidence and Analysis of Effect</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00024">As you begin to draft your rhetorical analysis, remember that you are giving your opinion on the author’s use of language. For example, Peterson has made a decision about the teaching of foreign languages, something readers of the newspaper might have different views on. In other words, there is room for debate and persuasion.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">The context of the situation in which Peterson finds himself may well be more complex than he discusses. In the same way, the context of the piece you choose to analyze may also be more complex. For example, perhaps Greendale is facing an economic crisis and <emphasis effect="italics">must</emphasis> pare its budget for educational spending and public works. It’s also possible that elected officials have made budget cuts for education a part of their platform or that school buildings have been found obsolete for safety measures. On the other hand, maybe a foreign company will come to town only if more Spanish speakers can be found locally. These factors would play a part in a real situation, and rhetoric would reflect that. If applicable, consider such possibilities regarding the subject of your analysis. Here, however, these factors are unknown and thus do not enter into the analysis.</para>
    <section id="sect-00006">
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para id="para-00026">One effective way to begin a rhetorical analysis is by using an anecdote, as Eliana Evans has done. For a rhetorical analysis of the opinion piece, a writer might consider an anecdote about a person who was in a situation in which knowing another language was important or not important. If they begin with an anecdote, the next part of the introduction should contain the following information:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
    <item>Author’s name and position, or other qualification to establish ethos</item>
    <item>Title of work and genre</item>
    <item>Author’s thesis statement or stance taken (“Peterson argues that . . .”)</item>
    <item>Brief introductory explanation of how the author develops and supports the thesis or stance</item>
    <item>If relevant, a brief summary of context and culture</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00027">Once the context and situation for the analysis are clear, move directly to your thesis statement. In this case, your thesis statement will be your opinion of how successful the author has been in achieving the established goal through the use of rhetorical strategies. Read the sentences in Table 9.1, and decide which would make the best thesis statement. Explain your reasoning in the right-hand column of this or a similar chart.</para>

    <caption>Rhetorical strategies</caption>
    </table>
    <para id="para-00031">When you have completed your list, consider how to structure your analysis. You will have to decide which of the writer’s statements are most effective. The strongest point would be a good place to begin; conversely, you could begin with the writer’s weakest point if that suits your purposes better. The most obvious organizational structure is one of the following:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
    <item>Go through the composition paragraph by paragraph and analyze its rhetorical content, focusing on the strategies that support the writer’s thesis statement.</item>
    <item>Address key rhetorical strategies individually, and show how the author has used them.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00032">As you read the next few paragraphs, consult Table 9.3 for a visual plan of your rhetorical analysis. Your first body paragraph is the first of the analytical paragraphs. Here, too, you have options for organizing. You might begin by stating the writer’s strongest point. For example, you could emphasize that Peterson appeals to ethos by speaking personally to readers as fellow citizens and providing his credentials to establish credibility as someone trustworthy with their interests at heart.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Following this point, your next one can focus, for instance, on Peterson’s view that cutting foreign language instruction is a danger to the education of Greendale’s children. The points that follow support this argument, and you can track his rhetoric as he does so.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">You may then use the second or third body paragraph, connected by a transition, to discuss Peterson’s appeal to logos. One possible transition might read, “To back up his assertion that omitting foreign languages is detrimental to education, Peterson provides examples and statistics.” Locate examples and quotes from the text as needed. You can discuss how, in citing these statistics, Peterson uses logos as a key rhetorical strategy.</para>
    <para id="para-00035">In another paragraph, focus on other rhetorical elements, such as parallelism, repetition, and rhetorical questions. Moreover, be sure to indicate whether the writer acknowledges counterclaims and whether they are accepted or ultimately rejected.</para>
    <para id="para-00036">The question of other factors at work in Greendale regarding finances, or similar factors in another setting, may be useful to mention here if they exist. As you continue, however, keep returning to your list of rhetorical strategies and explaining them. Even if some appear less important, they should be noted to show that you recognize how the writer is using language. You will likely have a minimum of four body paragraphs, but you may well have six or seven or even more, depending on the work you are analyzing.</para>
    <para id="para-00037">In your final body paragraph, you might discuss the argument that Peterson, for example, has made by appealing to readers’ emotions. His calls for solidarity at the end of the letter provide a possible solution to his concern that the foreign language curriculum “might vanish like a puff of smoke.”</para>
    <para id="para-00038">Use Table 9.3 to organize your rhetorical analysis. Be sure that each paragraph has a topic sentence and that you use transitions to flow smoothly from one idea to the next.</para>

The real function of the conclusion is to confirm your evaluation and show that you understand the use of the language and the effectiveness of the argument.</para>
    <para id="para-00042">In your analysis, note that objections could be raised because Peterson, for example, speaks only for himself. You may speculate about whether the next edition of the newspaper will feature an opposing opinion piece from someone who disagrees.

    <title>The Golden Rule</title>
    <para id="para-00051">An important part of the peer review process is to keep in mind the familiar wisdom of the “Golden Rule”: treat others as you would have them treat you. This foundational approach to human relations extends to commenting on others’ work. Like your peers, you are in the same situation of needing opinion and guidance. Whatever you have written will seem satisfactory or better to you because you have written it and know what you mean to say.</para>
    <para id="para-00052">However, your peers have the advantage of distance from the work you have written and can see it through their own eyes. Likewise, if you approach your peer’s work fairly and free of personal bias, you’re likely to be more constructive in finding parts of their writing that need revision. Most important, though, is to make suggestions tactfully and considerately, in the spirit of helping, not degrading someone’s work. You and your peers may be reluctant to share your work, but if everyone approaches the review process with these ideas in mind, everyone will benefit from the opportunity to provide and act on sincerely offered suggestions.</para>

    <title>Staying Open to Feedback and Working with It</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00053">Once the peer review process is complete, your next step is to revise the first draft by incorporating suggestions and making changes on your own. Consider some of these potential issues when incorporating peers’ revisions and rethinking your own work.</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00011">
    <item>Too much summarizing rather than analyzing</item>
    <item>Too much informal language or an unintentional mix of casual and formal language</item>
    <item>Too few, too many, or inappropriate transitions</item>
    <item>Illogical or unclear sequence of information</item>
    <item>Insufficient evidence to support main ideas effectively</item>
    <item>Too many generalities rather than specific facts, maybe from trying to do too much in too little time</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00054">In any case, revising a draft is a necessary step to produce a final work. Rarely will even a professional writer arrive at the best point in a single draft. In other words, it’s seldom a problem if your first draft needs refocusing. However, it may become a problem if you don’t address it. The best way to shape a wandering piece of writing is to return to it, reread it, slow it down, take it apart, and build it back up again. Approach first-draft writing for what it is: a warm-up or rehearsal for a final performance.</para>

    <title>Suggestions for Revising</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00055">When revising, be sure your thesis statement is clear and fulfills your purpose. Verify that you have abundant supporting evidence and that details are consistently on topic and relevant to your position. Just before arriving at the conclusion, be sure you have prepared a logical ending. The concluding statement should be strong and should not present any new points. Rather, it should grow out of what has already been said and return, in some degree, to the thesis statement. In the example of Octavio Peterson, his purpose was to persuade readers that teaching foreign languages in schools in Greendale should continue; therefore, the conclusion can confirm that Peterson achieved, did not achieve, or partially achieved his aim.</para>
    <para id="para-00056">When revising, make sure the larger elements of the piece are as you want them to be before you revise individual sentences and make smaller changes. If you make small changes first, they might not fit well with the big picture later on.</para>
    <para id="para-00057">One approach to big-picture revising is to check the organization as you move from paragraph to paragraph. You can list each paragraph and check that its content relates to the purpose and thesis statement. Each paragraph should have one main point and be self-contained in showing how the rhetorical devices used in the text strengthen (or fail to strengthen) the argument and the writer’s ability to persuade. Be sure your paragraphs flow logically from one to the other without distracting gaps or inconsistencies.</para>
