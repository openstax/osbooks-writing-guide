You will often be asked to explain or to express an opinion about what someone else has communicated and how that person has done so, especially if you take an active interest in politics and government.

    <title>Summary of Assignment: Rhetorical Analysis</title>
    <para id="para-00003">The assignment is to write a rhetorical analysis of a piece of persuasive writing. It can be an editorial, a movie or book review, an essay, a chapter in a book, or a letter to the editor. For your rhetorical analysis, you will need to consider the rhetorical situation—subject, author, purpose, context, audience, and culture—and the strategies the author uses in creating the argument. Back up all your claims with evidence from the text. In preparing your analysis, consider these questions:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item>What is the subject? Be sure to distinguish what the piece is about.</item>
    <item>Who is the writer, and what do you know about them? Be sure you know whether the writer is considered objective or has a particular agenda.</item>
    <item>Who are the readers? What do you know or what can you find out about them as the particular audience to be addressed at this moment?</item>
    <item>What is the purpose or aim of this work? What does the author hope to achieve?</item>
    <item>What are the time/space/place considerations and influences of the writer? What can you know about the writer and the full context in which they are writing?</item>
    <item>What specific techniques has the writer used to make their points? Are these techniques successful, unsuccessful, or questionable?</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00004">For this assignment, read the following opinion piece by Octavio Peterson, printed in his local newspaper. You may choose it as the text you will analyze, continuing the analysis on your own, or you may refer to it as a sample as you work on another text of your choosing. Your instructor may suggest presidential or other political speeches, which make good subjects for rhetorical analysis.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">When you have read the piece by Peterson advocating for the need to continue teaching foreign languages in schools, reflect carefully on the impact the letter has had on you. You are not expected to agree or disagree with it. Instead, focus on the rhetoric—the way Peterson uses language to make his point and convince you of the validity of his argument.</para>
    <para class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00006"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens.</emphasis></emphasis> Consider presenting your rhetorical analysis in a multimodal format. Use a blogging site or platform such as WordPress or Tumblr to explore the blogging genre, which includes video clips, images, hyperlinks, and other media to further your discussion. Because this genre is less formal than written text, your tone can be conversational. However, you still will be required to provide the same kind of analysis that you would in a traditional essay. The same materials will be at your disposal for making appeals to persuade your readers. Rhetorical analysis in a blog may be a new forum for the exchange of ideas that retains the basics of more formal communication. When you have completed your work, share it with a small group or the rest of the class. See <link document="m00001">Multimodal and Online Writing: Creative Interaction between Text and Image</link> for more about creating a multimodal composition.</para>

    <title>Start with a Thesis Statement</title>
    <para class="annotation dreaming-icon linguistic-icon" id="para-00022">After you have read this opinion piece, or another of your choice, several times and have a clear understanding of it as a piece of rhetoric, consider whether the writer has succeeded in being persuasive. You might find that in some ways they have and in others they have not. Then, with a clear understanding of your purpose—to analyze how the writer seeks to persuade—you can start framing a <term id="term-00001">thesis statement</term>: a declarative sentence that states the topic, the angle you are taking, and the aspects of the topic the rest of the paper will support.</para>

    <section class="drafting" id="sect-00005">
    <title>Text Evidence and Analysis of Effect</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00024">As you begin to draft your rhetorical analysis, remember that you are giving your opinion on the author’s use of language. For example, Peterson has made a decision about the teaching of foreign languages, something readers of the newspaper might have different views on. In other words, there is room for debate and persuasion.</para>
    <para id="para-00025">The context of the situation in which Peterson finds himself may well be more complex than he discusses. In the same way, the context of the piece you choose to analyze may also be more complex. For example, perhaps Greendale is facing an economic crisis and <emphasis effect="italics">must</emphasis> pare its budget for educational spending and public works. It’s also possible that elected officials have made budget cuts for education a part of their platform or that school buildings have been found obsolete for safety measures. On the other hand, maybe a foreign company will come to town only if more Spanish speakers can be found locally. These factors would play a part in a real situation, and rhetoric would reflect that. If applicable, consider such possibilities regarding the subject of your analysis. Here, however, these factors are unknown and thus do not enter into the analysis.</para>
    <section id="sect-00006">
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para id="para-00026">One effective way to begin a rhetorical analysis is by using an anecdote, as Eliana Evans has done. For a rhetorical analysis of the opinion piece, a writer might consider an anecdote about a person who was in a situation in which knowing another language was important or not important. If they begin with an anecdote, the next part of the introduction should contain the following information:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00004">
    <item>Author’s name and position, or other qualification to establish ethos</item>
    <item>Title of work and genre</item>
    <item>Author’s thesis statement or stance taken (“Peterson argues that . . .”)</item>
    <item>Brief introductory explanation of how the author develops and supports the thesis or stance</item>
    <item>If relevant, a brief summary of context and culture</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00027">Once the context and situation for the analysis are clear, move directly to your thesis statement. In this case, your thesis statement will be your opinion of how successful the author has been in achieving the established goal through the use of rhetorical strategies. Read the sentences in <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00093"/>, and decide which would make the best thesis statement. Explain your reasoning in the right-hand column of this or a similar chart.</para>

    <caption>Rhetorical strategies</caption>
    </table>
    <para id="para-00031">When you have completed your list, consider how to structure your analysis. You will have to decide which of the writer’s statements are most effective. The strongest point would be a good place to begin; conversely, you could begin with the writer’s weakest point if that suits your purposes better. The most obvious organizational structure is one of the following:</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00005">
    <item>Go through the composition paragraph by paragraph and analyze its rhetorical content, focusing on the strategies that support the writer’s thesis statement.</item>
    <item>Address key rhetorical strategies individually, and show how the author has used them.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00032">As you read the next few paragraphs, consult <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00093"/> for a visual plan of your rhetorical analysis. Your first body paragraph is the first of the analytical paragraphs. Here, too, you have options for organizing. You might begin by stating the writer’s strongest point. For example, you could emphasize that Peterson appeals to ethos by speaking personally to readers as fellow citizens and providing his credentials to establish credibility as someone trustworthy with their interests at heart.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">Following this point, your next one can focus, for instance, on Peterson’s view that cutting foreign language instruction is a danger to the education of Greendale’s children. The points that follow support this argument, and you can track his rhetoric as he does so.</para>
    <para id="para-00034">You may then use the second or third body paragraph, connected by a transition, to discuss Peterson’s appeal to logos. One possible transition might read, “To back up his assertion that omitting foreign languages is detrimental to education, Peterson provides examples and statistics.” Locate examples and quotes from the text as needed. You can discuss how, in citing these statistics, Peterson uses logos as a key rhetorical strategy.</para>
    <para id="para-00035">In another paragraph, focus on other rhetorical elements, such as parallelism, repetition, and rhetorical questions. Moreover, be sure to indicate whether the writer acknowledges counterclaims and whether they are accepted or ultimately rejected.</para>
    <para id="para-00036">The question of other factors at work in Greendale regarding finances, or similar factors in another setting, may be useful to mention here if they exist. As you continue, however, keep returning to your list of rhetorical strategies and explaining them. Even if some appear less important, they should be noted to show that you recognize how the writer is using language. You will likely have a minimum of four body paragraphs, but you may well have six or seven or even more, depending on the work you are analyzing.</para>
    <para id="para-00037">In your final body paragraph, you might discuss the argument that Peterson, for example, has made by appealing to readers’ emotions. His calls for solidarity at the end of the letter provide a possible solution to his concern that the foreign language curriculum “might vanish like a puff of smoke.”</para>
    <para id="para-00038">Use <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00093"/> to organize your rhetorical analysis. Be sure that each paragraph has a topic sentence and that you use transitions to flow smoothly from one idea to the next.</para>

Your opinion, as framed in your conclusion, may restate your thesis statement in different words, or you may choose to reveal your thesis at this point. The real function of the conclusion is to confirm your evaluation and show that you understand the use of the language and the effectiveness of the argument.</para>
    <para id="para-00042">In your analysis, note that objections could be raised because Peterson, for example, speaks only for himself. You may speculate about whether the next edition of the newspaper will feature an opposing opinion piece from someone who disagrees. However, it is not necessary to provide answers to questions you raise here. Your conclusion should summarize briefly how the writer has made, or failed to make, a forceful argument that may require further debate.</para>

    <title>The Golden Rule</title>
    <para id="para-00051">An important part of the peer review process is to keep in mind the familiar wisdom of the “Golden Rule”: treat others as you would have them treat you. This foundational approach to human relations extends to commenting on others’ work. Like your peers, you are in the same situation of needing opinion and guidance. Whatever you have written will seem satisfactory or better to you because you have written it and know what you mean to say.</para>
    <para id="para-00052">However, your peers have the advantage of distance from the work you have written and can see it through their own eyes. Likewise, if you approach your peer’s work fairly and free of personal bias, you’re likely to be more constructive in finding parts of their writing that need revision. Most important, though, is to make suggestions tactfully and considerately, in the spirit of helping, not degrading someone’s work. You and your peers may be reluctant to share your work, but if everyone approaches the review process with these ideas in mind, everyone will benefit from the opportunity to provide and act on sincerely offered suggestions.</para>

    <title>Staying Open to Feedback and Working with It</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00053">Once the peer review process is complete, your next step is to revise the first draft by incorporating suggestions and making changes on your own. Consider some of these potential issues when incorporating peers’ revisions and rethinking your own work.</para>

    <item>Too much summarizing rather than analyzing</item>

    <para id="para-00054">In any case, revising a draft is a necessary step to produce a final work. Rarely will even a professional writer arrive at the best point in a single draft. In other words, it’s seldom a problem if your first draft needs refocusing. However, it may become a problem if you don’t address it. The best way to shape a wandering piece of writing is to return to it, reread it, slow it down, take it apart, and build it back up again. Approach first-draft writing for what it is: a warm-up or rehearsal for a final performance.</para>
    <section id="sect-00012">
    <title>Suggestions for Revising</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00055">When revising, be sure your thesis statement is clear and fulfills your purpose. Verify that you have abundant supporting evidence and that details are consistently on topic and relevant to your position. Just before arriving at the conclusion, be sure you have prepared a logical ending. The concluding statement should be strong and should not present any new points. Rather, it should grow out of what has already been said and return, in some degree, to the thesis statement. In the example of Octavio Peterson, his purpose was to persuade readers that teaching foreign languages in schools in Greendale should continue; therefore, the conclusion can confirm that Peterson achieved, did not achieve, or partially achieved his aim.</para>
