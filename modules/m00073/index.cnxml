      <para id="para-00002">Throughout this chapter, you have learned about the review genre. You have learned that reviews evaluate a variety of items. In addition to books, films, and TV shows, people look to reviews to buy cars, choose restaurants, hire plumbers, and more. In this section, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the review genre by composing your own review.</para>

      <title>Summary of Assignment: Review of Primary Media Source</title>
      <para class="annotation culture-icon visual-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00003">Write a review of a specific film, book, TV series, podcast, play, or video game that you think contributes something significant to the genre and to the culture at large. Show how the subject—the primary source—of your review illustrates something compelling or exceptional about a particular idea or theme common to the genre. For example, the CW series <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001"><emphasis effect="italics">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</emphasis></term> (2015–2019) is a romantic comedy that eschews and even satirizes traditional romantic comedy tropes such as the “grand gesture,” doing something out of love for someone. Use specific evidence from your primary source to support a central idea, or thesis. In an essay of about 1,200 to 1,500 words, provide an overall judgment about your subject and support it with evidence from the primary source and from secondary sources if applicable. In addition, explore how your specific source has contributed something significant to its genre. In other words, <emphasis effect="italics">why is this subject interesting, different, or worthy of analysis?</emphasis> Be sure to demonstrate awareness of your source’s cultural and historical context as well. For example, if your review is about a romantic comedy, provide relevant information about the history, conventions, or expectations of that genre. Think about and explain the ways your topic adheres to or breaks from audience expectations.</para>
      <para class="annotation auditory-icon" id="para-00004"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens 1.</emphasis></emphasis> Create a three-to-five-minute podcast review of a specific <link url="https://openstax.org/r/film">film</link>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/book">book</link>, TV series, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/album">album</link>, podcast, play, or video game. <emphasis effect="italics">How does the subject of your review illustrate something interesting or unique about a particular idea or theme common to the genre?</emphasis> Integrate specific evidence from the primary source and secondary sources, if applicable, to support a main idea, or thesis.</para>
      <para id="para-00005">To record your podcast review, use either a simple recording method, such as the voice memo app on your smartphone, or something more sophisticated, such as <emphasis effect="italics">Garage Band</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">iMovie.</emphasis> To become more familiar with this genre of reviewing, listen to one or two of the examples linked above. Note how this genre is somewhat different from an academic essay. For example, the speaker’s voice is more conversational and engages the audience auditorily by stressing particular words or syllables. In your review podcast, take advantage of the opportunity to present a more informal tone than you might use in an academic essay. Podcast hosts are often successful because of their personality and ability to connect with their audience. Draft a script for your review podcast that reflects your personality and use of language, rather than formal language. For example, use contractions, first- or second-person pronouns, and appropriate slang.</para>
      <para id="para-00006">Finally, to maximize the effect of your podcast, consider incorporating short clips from the subject of your review. Upload your podcast review to <link url="https://openstax.org/r/SoundCloud">SoundCloud</link> and share your review with the class. For more direction on public speaking, consult <link document="m00166">Scripting for the Public Forum: Writing to Speak</link>.</para>
      <para id="para-00007"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens 2.</emphasis></emphasis> Instead of a straightforward review of a single primary source, review several sources in the same genre, as Caelia Marshall has done in her essay. Or compare a film to the book on which it is based and evaluate it. Select your sources from films, books, television programs, video games, or any other form of entertainment, focusing your review essay on a single area, such as social context, character development, or screenplay vs. original text. Choose other genre-specific evaluation criteria as well, and address them in your essay, as Marshall does. Use specific evidence from your primary sources and secondary sources, as needed, to support your main idea, or thesis. In other words, <emphasis effect="italics">why is this source interesting, different, or worthy of analysis?</emphasis></para>

      <title>Developing Evaluative Criteria</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00008">To write an effective review, you need clear and relevant evaluation criteria. To help you establish your review criteria, fill in a table similar to <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00073"/> by following these steps:</para>
      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00002">
      <item>Write the name of your primary source.</item>
      <item>In the left-hand column, write the genre category to which your topic belongs (horror, action, biography, etc.).</item>
      <item>Under the genre, brainstorm as many characteristics of the genre as you can.</item>
      <item>In the right-hand column, write “Examples.”</item>
      <item>Brainstorm as much evidence from your primary source as you can think of.</item>
      <item>Create a second table called “Subgenre.” For example, if your topic is a horror film, some possible subgenres might be “ghost horror,” “monster horror,” or “slasher horror.” Add a colon after <emphasis effect="italics">Subgenre</emphasis>, and write the subgenre type.</item>
      <item>Label the left-hand column “Subgenre Elements” and the right-hand column “How to Evaluate.”</item>
      <item>In the Subgenre Elements column, brainstorm for as many characteristics of the subgenre as you can. You can use some relevant characteristics from step 3, but try to focus on unique characteristics of the subgenre. For example, what makes a horror film about a ghost, such as <emphasis effect="italics">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Grudge</term></emphasis> (2020), different from a slasher horror film, such as <emphasis effect="italics">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</term></emphasis> (2003)?</item>
      <item>In the right-hand column, develop questions to assess characteristics.</item>
      <item>Select three to five genre characteristics with the most evidence, and focus on them as you look closely at your primary sources. Take notes and gather evidence to support your evaluation.</item>

      <title>Thesis Statement, Analysis, and Supporting Examples</title>
      <para id="para-00013">After you have selected a topic and decided on the evaluation criteria, spend some time looking closely at your primary source (the film, TV show, book, etc. you have chosen to review). With these criteria in mind, view/read/listen to your primary source. Take notes on how your selected evaluation criteria apply to your source. When you come across strong and relevant examples, write down vivid, detailed descriptions of the scene and quote applicable dialogue.

      <title>Secondary Source Evidence</title>
      <para id="para-00037">Once you form your own opinions, you may want to look for additional sources to support your review. Secondary sources, or sources that contain the opinions and analyses of others, are frequently used in academic writing to help writers support a point or provide background and context. Scholarly, peer-reviewed secondary sources give your review greater credibility because the articles are written by experts in their fields. Use your college library’s databases, or ask a librarian whether your college provides access to journals that publish articles on movies, television, and culture. Most colleges have access to JSTOR, a database search engine focused on the humanities. In addition, the MLA International Bibliography is a common database of journals related to culture. <link document="m00124">Research Process: Accessing and Recording Information</link> and <link document="m00131">Annotated Bibliography: Gathering, Evaluating, and Documenting Sources</link> provide more information about finding sources.</para>
      <para id="para-00038">Another, less academic, place to look for secondary sources is in <term id="term-00006">Recap</term>. In recent years, recapping has become a popular way to join the conversation about TV shows, with sites such as <emphasis effect="italics">The AV Club</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">The Huffington Post</emphasis>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/slate"><emphasis effect="italics">Slate</emphasis></link>, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/theverge"><emphasis effect="italics">The Verge</emphasis></link>, and <link url="https://openstax.org/r/vox"><emphasis effect="italics">Vox</emphasis></link> dedicating staff to summarizing and discussing popular shows.

      <para id="para-00039">Note, too, that well-known publications, such as <link url="https://openstax.org/r/thenewyorktimes"><emphasis effect="italics">The New York Times</emphasis></link>, review not only movies and TV shows but also products such as those you may have chosen to write your review about. In addition, <link url="https://openstax.org/r/consumerreports"><emphasis effect="italics">Consumer Reports</emphasis></link> is one of the longest-running magazines dedicated to reviewing products of all kinds.

      <title>Drafting the Introduction</title>
      <para id="para-00040">The <term id="term-00007">introduction</term> should interest readers in your topic and make them eager to learn more about it.

We are conditioned to believe there is one person we are destined to be with. Disney movies, TV shows like <emphasis effect="italics">The Office</emphasis>, Hallmark Channel Christmas movies, and traditional romantic comedies reinforce the notion that for the believer, true love is right around the corner. But everyone knows the pain of rejection or of pining for a person who doesn’t seem to notice them. The CW series <emphasis effect="italics">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</emphasis> shows what it’s like when love is more complicated than what we see in the movies. The show follows Rebecca Bunch, a successful but unhappy—and far from virtuous or admirable—New York lawyer who instantly abandons her life to move to West Covina, California, to pursue Josh Chan, her summer-camp crush from long ago. Rebecca cooks up crazy, desperate schemes to get the attention of the aloof and clueless Josh. <emphasis effect="italics">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</emphasis> masterfully taps into our inner crazy ex by making good comedy out of Instagram stalking, relationship sabotage, and infatuation.</para>

      <title>Drafting the Conclusion</title>
      <para id="para-00076">For the conclusion, summarize briefly how the criteria you used led you to your evaluation, rephrase or validate your thesis, and make a recommendation.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00077"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Conclusion example.</emphasis></emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is a refreshing take on the romantic comedy genre. It elevates comedy by using catchy, original songs to accompany clever dialogue. Though Rebecca is intense and extreme, her situation is relatable, and she comes across as more sympathetic than not, proving that people don’t have to be perfect to be deserving of love. The departures from the romantic comedy playbook leave the audience guessing what will happen next, ensuring the show never feels tired or stale. What comes after the grand gesture and big kiss? That’s a question this show tries to answer, and sooner than you might expect. If you’re looking for a new binge-worthy show, clear your calendar for the next week and give Crazy Ex-Girlfriend a try.</emphasis></para>

      <title>Conferencing with a Partner</title>
      <para id="para-00082">After you finish your draft, receiving feedback from a peer will help you identify the strengths and weaknesses in your review. Because writers sometimes find it hard to review their work from the perspective of their audience, peer feedback will help you see your writing in ways not obvious to you. As a peer reviewer yourself, try to offer suggestions to make the essay more like something you would want to read.</para>
      <para id="para-00083">To give and receive the most effective feedback, use the following guidelines:</para>
      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00004">
      <item>On your own draft, note the areas you are unsure about and where you especially want feedback. It’s a good idea to have specific questions so that your peer can focus on what you think will help you.</item>
      <item>When you are assigned a peer, read their essay at least once without commenting, just to get a sense of what the essay is about.</item>
      <item>Read the essay a second time. In the margins, add any comments or reactions to the essay.</item>
      <item>Focus on the introduction and comment on its effectiveness.
      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00005">
      <item>In what ways are the first few sentences engaging?</item>
      <item>Would you want to keep reading to learn more? Why or why not?</item>
      <item>In what ways does the introduction clearly establish what is being reviewed? Does it provide sufficient background information? In what ways does the thesis make a judgment or an evaluation with a reason that leads to the judgment or evaluation?</item>
      <item>Mark what you think the thesis is. If you find no clear thesis, mark something for the writer to focus on to arrive at a thesis.</item>
      <item>Jot down one or two prodding, open-ended questions to help the writer develop or revise the thesis.</item>
      </list></item>
      <item>Next, focus on the body paragraphs.
      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00006">
      <item>Is enough background provided, either in the introduction or early in the body, to give you a complete sense of what the writer is evaluating?</item>
      <item>If there is not enough background, jot down a few questions that could be answered with additional background and context.</item>
      <item>What is the main point of each body paragraph?</item>
      <item>In what ways do the main points support the thesis (my thesis is true because . . .)?</item>
      <item>Do the body paragraphs contain specific, concrete details from the primary source to support the main points?</item>
      <item>If the body needs more specific details, mark places where the writer can add more detail.</item>
      </list></item>
      <item>Next, focus on the conclusion.
      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00007">
      <item>Does the conclusion clearly tie up the main points?</item>
      <item>If not, how might the writer revise the conclusion?</item>
      </list></item>
      <item>Although your task is not to edit the essay or mark every error, point out any consistent patterns of grammatical errors.</item>
      <item>When you have finished, summarize your comments at the end of the review by writing three things on which your peer can focus when revising.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00084">As you work, be detailed and specific in your comments so that your peer can use them to make revisions:</para>
      <list id="list-00008">
      <item>What specifically is working or not working?</item>
      <item>Why is it working or not working?</item>
      <item>What can the writer do specifically to revise?</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00085">If you are having trouble finding something to comment on, remember that you can make comments about what the writer does well. Be sure to explain in detail why you think it’s working. Be sure to consult <link document="m00075">Evaluation: Effect on Audience</link> as well.</para>

      <section class="revising" id="sect-00016">
      <title>Maintaining Ownership</title>
      <para id="para-00086">When you receive your reviewed essay, look over the comments. Remember that they are merely suggestions; your revisions are ultimately up to you. For example, a sentence fragment, while technically incorrect, could be an effective way to emphasize a point. It is your call to decide whether your use of language is appropriate for your audience and purpose. With that said, however, it’s possible your peer pointed out something you did not notice.</para>
      <para id="para-00087">As you revise, keep in mind the following success criteria. Ensure your essay has them:</para>
      <list id="list-00009">
      <item><term id="term-00009">Specific topic</term><emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis> The essay is about a specific TV show, film, book, podcast, video game, or other primary source(s).</item>
      <item><term id="term-00010">Interesting lead</term><emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis> You show your audience why this topic interests you and try to capture their attention.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00011">Thesis</term><emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis> You present a clear, debatable, and specific thesis about your topic.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00012">Body</term><emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis> The body supports the thesis with clear main points. Summary is used effectively to provide background and context.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00013">Specific details</term><emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis> You support your main points with relevant and ample details (in the form of quotations, paraphrases, vivid descriptions, etc.) from the primary source or sources as well as secondary sources, if you have used them.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00014">Citation</term><emphasis effect="bold">:</emphasis> Sources are cited correctly in the text.</item>
