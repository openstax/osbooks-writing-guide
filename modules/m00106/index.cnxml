      <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00003">In a position argument, you are expected to provide evidence that supports your stance and addresses counterclaims to it.

      <para id="para-00005">If you are <emphasis effect="bold">summarizing</emphasis>, you are condensing the words of someone else into a shorter form but still retaining the main point and major details.

      <title>Intellectual property</title>
      <para id="para-00017">When you create a written work, you do not want someone else to take credit for it. It is your <term id="term-00003">intellectual property</term>, an original idea resulting from your creativity and work and that, consequently, you own. If you look at a book, for instance, you will see a copyright symbol (©) somewhere in the opening pages, usually along with other publication information. This symbol gives the copyright owner legal protection against those who try to <term id="term-00004">plagiarize</term> (steal material and publish it as their own). <emphasis effect="italics">Plagiarism</emphasis> can refer to entire works or parts of works that are not cited as being created by someone else, whether the work is copyrighted or not. If writers or speakers use someone else’s words, ideas, or information, they must cite the source.
