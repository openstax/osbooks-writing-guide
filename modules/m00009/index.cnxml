  </section>
  <para id="para-00002">After creating your multimodal advocacy project, think critically about the development process, including how you chose genres, modes, and specific media to include; your process for creating transitions; and ways in which you incorporated usability and accessibility into your finished project.</para>

  <title>Reflective Writing: Letter to Your Instructor</title>
  <para id="para-00003">As you reflect on your multimodal composition and the process you used to create it, answer these questions, supporting your answers with evidence from your project. Then compose a letter to your instructor that incorporates your answers and addresses any other parts of the composition process that come to mind.</para>
  <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
  <item>How would you articulate your role as a composer? (Hint: Who are you as the author—what is your identity in this role? To whom are you speaking, and for what purpose?)</item>
  <item>Why did you choose the advocacy topic that you did? Do you have a personal connection?</item>
  <item>On which parts of the composition process (planning, research, drafting, revising) did you spend the most time? Why did these parts occupy you the longest? What, if anything, would you change if you could do it again?</item>
  <item>How did considering your audience change your development process? What opportunities did you have to think critically about social and cultural issues?</item>
  <item>Why did you choose the rhetorical devices that you did? What factors helped you decide on them? How did the situation influence your rhetorical appeals?</item>
  <item>What factors helped you determine the primary genre, mode(s), and media you chose? Did you change those elements at any point in the composition process? If so, why?</item>
  <item>How did peer review and revision help clarify your ideas, organization, or composition?</item>
  <item>How did you show relationships between the ideas and media? What changes did you make to improve your transitions?</item>
  <item>What did you learn about your topic and the composition process through the revision process?</item>
  <item>How did you address considerations for usability and accessibility, using technology or otherwise?</item>
  <item>Which parts of the composition came more easily than others?</item>
