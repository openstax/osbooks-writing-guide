    <para id="para-00002">Below are the criteria that your instructor will use to assess your written work for this chapter. As you read them, consider how they align with the elements of visual rhetoric identified and analyzed throughout this chapter. As you plan, write, and revise, consult the following rubric carefully to ensure that you are meeting the critical cultural and rhetorical expectations for assessing images. Consider also ways you might usefully and creatively challenge such expectations—for example, by adopting a unique voice in which to write that rejects language such as “point of view” but still results in an effective piece of persuasive writing.</para>

    <entry>The text occasionally adheres to the “Editing Focus” of this chapter: using descriptive diction, as discussed in Section 17.6, and employing sensory detail.

The tone may be inconsistent and informal or unprofessional at times. There may be occasional lapses in vocabulary and comprehension as well.</entry>
