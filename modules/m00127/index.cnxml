      <para id="para-00001">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</para>
      <list id="list-00001">
      <item>Locate and evaluate primary and secondary research materials, including journal articles and essays, books, scholarly and professionally established and maintained databases or archives, and informal electronic networks and Internet sources.</item>
      <item>Practice and apply strategies such as interpretation, synthesis, response, and critique to compose texts that integrate the writer’s ideas with those from appropriate sources.</item>
      <item>Apply methods and technologies commonly used for research and communication in various fields.</item>

      <para id="para-00002">Your task in writing an argumentative research paper as outlined in <link document="m00119">Writing Process: Integrating Research</link> is to present original thinking that is supported by researched evidence. You may wonder how a college student will think of anything new to say about a topic that already has been researched by many others. First, keep in mind that your original thinking does not necessarily have to be groundbreaking—something never considered by others in the field—though it might be. Your original thinking may be something smaller but equally important, such as offering an alternative viewpoint on some evidence, interpreting existing evidence in a new way that sheds light on current questions in the field, or pointing out a flaw in the current thinking regarding a topic.</para>
      <section id="sect-00002">
      <title>Synthesis</title>
      <para id="para-00003">One skill that will help you develop this original thinking is <term id="term-00001">synthesis</term>. As explained in <link document="m00119">Writing Process: Integrating Research</link>, synthesis involves combining information gathered from various sources and making connections among those sources to create a new, deeper, or changed understanding of a topic. In other words, you examine how information or opinions you have read in one place relate to what you have read in another place or to your own thoughts. To practice the skill of synthesis, use <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00127"/>, which illustrates how thinking can change like ripples of water.</para>
      <figure id="fig-00001"><media alt="A water drop is encircled by three lines, creating a ripple effect. The  lines read from inner to outer, “Before I began my research, I was thinking …”, “During my research, I began thinking …”, and “After my research, I am now thinking …”">

      <title>Keeping Track of Sources</title>
      <para id="para-00004">Because unorganized or incorrectly documented research may be less than useless, many researchers make the effort to keep their notes and comments on their sources in a <term id="term-00002">research log</term>. An organized record of all sources consulted, a research log includes publication information, notes taken from the sources, and commentary about their relation to other sources or to the thesis of your paper. Having a dynamic tool such as this makes it easier to document sources in your works cited or references list and place in-text citations in your paper. It also helps with the research itself, showing at a glance what information you already have and where it comes from so that you can avoid repetition. Equally important, commentary on notes helps you synthesize information efficiently.</para>
