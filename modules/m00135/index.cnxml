    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00002">Now it is time to try your hand at creating your own annotated bibliography. As you work through identifying and writing about your sources, you may want to seek out additional ones to help support your argument or thesis. This recursive process is similar to the fine-tuning that occurs during the writing process, in which a writer moves fluidly among drafting, editing, and revising. You can return to your annotated bibliography during the course of research and writing to modify, further develop, analyze, and add to your sources. Remember, using a variety of sources can broaden your perspective about your topic by showing how different scholars and popular publications approach it.</para>

    <title>Summary of Assignment: Annotated Bibliography</title>
    <para id="para-00003">For this assignment, you will create an annotated bibliography based on your research for one of the writing assignments in this course, preferably <link document="m00119">Writing Process: Integrating Research</link>. After collecting and choosing sources, you will write citations using <link target-id="sect-00012" document="m00184">MLA Documentation and Format</link> and compose a one- or two-paragraph annotation for each source. Remember, the purpose of the annotation is to provide</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00002">
    <item>a brief summary that allows readers to understand the background of the source and its basic claims; and</item>

    </list>
    <para class="annotation culture-icon" id="para-00004">While the format for your MLA citation should follow the prescriptive pattern from the Handbook, you will decide on the language and structure of the annotations you include. While your topic, personal style, and ideas may lend themselves to a more standardized format, it is possible that they may instead challenge codified conventions in favor of a style more authentic to you.</para>

    <title>Organizing Information</title>
    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon dreaming-icon" id="para-00007">Begin by collecting sources. A good way to start is to make a list of keywords, known authors, organizations, and previously identified sources related to your topic. For example, imagine you have been assigned an argument project and chosen artificial intelligence as the topic. Begin, then, with the keywords <emphasis effect="italics">artificial intelligence</emphasis>. A Google search will reveal a wealth of information on the topic, likely too much to help you craft a meaningful argument. However, a basic search will allow you to</para>
    <list list-type="bulleted" id="list-00003">
    <item>effectively define <emphasis effect="italics">artificial intelligence</emphasis> as “the simulation of human intelligence by machines programmed to mimic human thought and actions”;</item>
    <item>name four types of artificial intelligence: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware;</item>
    <item>identify leading industries in which artificial intelligence is already present, such as self-driving cars and virtual butlers; and</item>
    <item>recognize the existence of a spectrum of thought surrounding the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00008">You also may discover some alternative search terms to use, such as <emphasis effect="italics">machine learning</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">data mining</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">robotics</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">neuroscience</emphasis>. Although you may not ultimately use them in your argument, the sources that you find may point you toward a focused thesis.</para>
    <para id="para-00009">When you finish your keyword search, the next step is to search academic databases. Use your library’s resources to find scholarly sources such as journal articles, books, textbooks, expert interviews, and reputable periodical pieces. Aim for five to seven sources to begin with, though you likely will add more as you work on your project. You may already have an idea of what claims you want to make in your argument, but the sources may shape them as well. As you review the sources you collect, choose those that give you a varied range of perspectives on the topic. Remember that you can return to this procedure at various points in your research, adding sources as your needs change and as you refine your claims. While you search for sources, keep in mind the specifics of your research project, and limit your search to sources that specifically support your argument, inform a counterargument, or otherwise add information that enhances your research.</para>

    <title>Thesis</title>
    <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00010">Before you choose sources, you must have an idea of what you want to say. If you’re creating an annotated bibliography for the argument described <link document="m00119">Writing Process: Integrating Research</link>, you likely have already drafted a thesis statement. If you are creating an annotated bibliography for another topic, you will need to draft a working thesis. Your thesis will state your position on the topic. It is often a single clear, concise sentence that reveals your side in the argument. You will use your sources to support the thesis you draft.</para>

As you first collect your sources, briefly review and examine the information they contain, specifically through the lens of how each can add to your research.

    <para id="para-00018">For some sources, you may be unable to find information for each category. In particular, for sources that are very short or from which you use only one or two bits of information, your annotations will not be long or complex, and your graphic organizer may seem sparse. That is to be expected. What is important at this stage is to identify how you will use your resources as they relate to your argument or thesis.</para>
    <para id="para-00019">After you have outlined your sources by using the graphic organizer or a similar method, it is time to start writing the actual annotations. Remember the three tasks in writing an annotation:</para>
    <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00006">
    <item><term id="term-00001">Summarize</term> the central idea or scope of the source, particularly as it relates to your research project.</item>
    <item><term id="term-00002">Evaluate</term> the source for authority, author’s perspective, reliability, validity, and bias.</item>
    <item><term id="term-00003">Reflect</term> on how the source affects your research and your thinking.</item>
    </list>
    <para id="para-00020">Your annotated bibliography should include at least some of these functions and, depending on the source, may contain all of them. Below is an example of an annotated bibliography entry for the article on artificial intelligence. The entry begins with the correctly formatted citation, followed by two paragraphs summarizing, evaluating, and reflecting. Because you already have completed the graphic organizer, much of the analysis is already done there. Simply take that thinking and shape it into useful paragraphs, like those the writer created here.</para>

    <title>Formatting</title>
    <para id="para-00032">The format of an annotated bibliography can vary depending on the discipline and purpose. Therefore, be clear at the outset which style you need to use. In academic writing, that information often will come from your instructor. Generally, annotated bibliographies will be written in <link target-id="sect-00012" document="m00184">MLA Documentation and Format</link>, <link target-id="sect-00013" document="m00184">APA Documentation and Format</link>, or Chicago style.</para>
    <para id="para-00033">This text uses MLA style. MLA source citations follow several principles in place of specific rules. The style has been adapted in recent years to respond to the evolving nature of text in an increasingly digital world. Thus, the <emphasis effect="italics">MLA Handbook</emphasis> is organized by the <emphasis effect="italics">process</emphasis> of citation, rather than listing rules for every type of source. However, certain overall guidelines apply. When you cite a source, first identify core elements that are present. Remember from earlier in this chapter that these are author(s), title of source, title of container, version, number, publisher, publication date, and location.</para>

    <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00036"><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">Title of Container.</emphasis> The container, highlighted in teal, is the larger work to which a source belongs. An article may belong to a website or journal, a song to an album, or a video to a video-sharing site. This container comes next in the citation. It is generally italicized and followed by a comma. However, some sources do not have containers; for example, a book (versus a chapter in a book) or an entire website (versus a single page on a website) is self-contained and thus has no container to cite.</emphasis></para>

    <title>Alphabetizing and Indenting</title>
    <para id="para-00043">Other rules also apply to MLA citations in a research project. Most of these are formatting and style rules that add to a polished final product. Remember to list sources in alphabetical order according to the author’s last name. If the source has more than one author, list it according to the last name of the first author mentioned. If the source has no author named, insert it into your alphabetical list according to the first word in the title. For example, if Miriam C. Buiten’s name were not mentioned, you would enter the item under <emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis>, the first letter of the first word in the title, <emphasis effect="italics">Towards</emphasis>. In your bibliography, double-space the citation, and do not leave a space between entries.</para>
    <para id="para-00044">In an annotated bibliography, indent the entire annotation in the same manner as the source citation after the first line. In most word processing programs, you can create this formatting by highlighting the citation and annotation paragraphs and then creating a hanging indent. In Microsoft Word, open the Paragraph Settings icon on the Home tab. Under the tab that reads Indents and Spacing, find the section labeled Indentation. On the right side of that section is the label Special. Click the drop-down menu, and choose Hanging. Different word processing programs may require you to create hanging indentations in another way. Consult an MLA guide often to ensure that your citations are correct.</para>

Although there is no set format for writing annotations, remember to write them in paragraph form and to summarize, evaluate, and/or reflect. Annotation lengths will vary depending on the length of the source, how it is used in your project, and how much analysis you do within the annotation. However, a general length of one to two paragraphs consisting of 100 to 200 words is roughly the standard.</para>

    <title>Descriptive/Informative and Analytical/Critical Annotations</title>
    <para id="para-00046">There are two major types of annotated bibliographies. The first is <term id="term-00004">descriptive</term>, or informative, summarizing the material and explaining why the source is useful for your topic. This type of annotated bibliography also points out special features of the text, including any data, graphics, or other characteristics. Although you discuss the author’s main arguments and conclusions, you do not analyze or evaluate them. Descriptive annotations are useful for helping readers understand an author’s main ideas but less helpful for showing how the source has influenced the research project as a whole.</para>
    <para id="para-00047">The other type of annotated bibliography is <term id="term-00005">analytical</term>, or critical. This type includes all the features of a descriptive annotated bibliography, including a summary of the material. In addition, it includes your analysis of the information in each source and explanation of how the source has influenced the development of your research. With analytical or critical annotations, you examine the strengths, weaknesses, and biases present in the author’s information and explain how the author’s work and conclusions apply to your research.</para>
    <para id="para-00048">In projects for this course, especially those using arguments, you will almost always create analytical or critical annotated bibliographies, though the detail in which you analyze may vary from source to source. The detail in these bibliographies will contribute to your knowledge base and provide information for others.</para>
