    <para id="para-00001">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</para>
    <list id="list-00001">
    <item>Demonstrate, through writing, the discovery and reconsideration of ideas.</item>
    <item>Reflect on the development of composing practices and how those practices influence your work.</item>
    </list>
    </section>
    <para id="para-00002">In this reflection, think about your participation in the chapter as you learned about and completed a rhetorical analysis assignment. Participation includes thoughtful completion of work, working with other students in peer review, interacting with your instructor, and raising questions or concerns.</para>
    <section id="sect-00002">
    <title>Summing Up and Looking Ahead</title>
    <para id="para-00003">An effective way to reflect productively is to compose a “Sum Up” entry for yourself that you can share with your instructor or peers. Your “Reflection on Analysis” may include what you knew of the genre before working on this chapter and what your initial reactions were to reading about Jamil Smith as this chapter’s Trailblazer. Will you look forward to reading more of his work?</para>
    <para id="para-00004">You also may note your writing of the rhetorical analysis and articulate any remaining questions about language use. Might the experience lead you to express yourself in a similar public forum? Which issues interest you the most?</para>
    <para id="para-00005">While working through the sections of the chapter, did you find any well suited to your pace and style of writing? As you reflect, discuss in your own terms and in any format you choose what you learned from the material and what, specifically, you believe will be most useful for you in your education.</para>
