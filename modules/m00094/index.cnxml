    <para class="annotation linguistic-icon" id="para-00002">A mixed-construction sentence contains parts that do not fit together because of grammatical structure or meaning. These <link target-id="sect-00003" document="m00184">sentence errors</link> occur when writers begin a statement in one way, or one direction, and then unintentionally change grammatical paths. This kind of sentence construction can detract from an otherwise solidly analytical text.</para>

    <item><para id="para-00003"><emphasis effect="bold">Mixed Sentence 1:</emphasis> Learning to ballroom dance it has shown increased agility, and you live longer.</para>
    <para id="para-00004"><emphasis effect="bold">First Problem:</emphasis> The reader expects a verb to follow “learning to ballroom dance” so that <emphasis effect="italics">learning</emphasis> will mean something. But the word <emphasis effect="italics">it</emphasis> interrupts before the verb appears. <emphasis effect="italics">It</emphasis> collides with the first part of the sentence rather than completing it, and the sentence ends up making little sense.</para>
    <para id="para-00005"><emphasis effect="bold">Second Problem:</emphasis> The second part of the sentence, “and you live longer,” is confusing because it introduces <emphasis effect="italics">you</emphasis> instead of continuing the idea of learning to ballroom dance.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">To eliminate confusion, you would have to rewrite either the first or the second part of the sentence.</para>
    <para id="para-00007"><emphasis effect="bold">Revised:</emphasis> Studies have shown that learning to ballroom dance increases agility and lengthens life span.</para></item>

    <para id="para-00024"><emphasis effect="italics">Just because . . . doesn’t mean</emphasis> constructions are common in speech but should be avoided in writing. They are another example of mixed sentence construction.</para>

    <item><para id="para-00028"><emphasis effect="italics"><emphasis effect="bold">Is When</emphasis> Construction:</emphasis> A feeling of accomplishment is when I finish revising a paper.</para>
    <para id="para-00029"><emphasis effect="bold">Problem:</emphasis> “A feeling of accomplishment” is a noun phrase followed by a linking verb. This construction means that what follows the verb either describes the noun or renames it in different words. Therefore, to balance the sentence, you need an adjective or noun to complete the subject. <emphasis effect="italics">When</emphasis>, however, is an adverb referring to time, and in this sentence, it begins an adverb clause. In other words, “a feeling” cannot be the same as or described in terms of time.</para>
