      <para id="para-00002">If you like science and technical fields and you like to write, you may want to explore technical writing as a career path. Technical writers usually have a degree in English, journalism, or communication. Often, they also have knowledge, college coursework, or a degree in a specialized field such as computer science, engineering, medicine, biology, agriculture, and other technical fields, such as manufacturing, construction, welding, and plumbing; however, companies will usually train technical writers on the subject needed and the style in which the writers they employ need to write.</para>
