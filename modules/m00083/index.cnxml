      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00002">You might think that writing comes easily to experienced writers—that they draft stories and college papers all at once, sitting down at the computer and having sentences flow from their fingers like water from a faucet. In reality, most writers engage in a <term id="term-00001">recursive</term> process, pushing forward, stepping back, and repeating steps multiple times as their ideas develop and change. In broad strokes, the steps most writers go through are these:</para>
      <list id="list-00002">
      <item><term id="term-00002">Planning</term> <emphasis effect="bold">and</emphasis> <term id="term-00025">Organization</term>. You will have an easier time drafting if you devote time at the beginning to consider the rhetorical situation for your report, understand your assignment, gather ideas and information, draft a thesis statement, and create an organizational plan.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00003">Drafting</term>. When you have an idea of what you want to say and the order in which you want to say it, you’re ready to draft. As much as possible, keep going until you have a complete first draft of your report, resisting the urge to go back and rewrite. Save that for after you have completed a first draft.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00004">Review</term>. Now is the time to get feedback from others, whether from your instructor, your classmates, a tutor in the writing center, your roommate, someone in your family, or someone else you trust to read your writing critically and give you honest feedback.</item>
      <item><term id="term-00005">Revising</term>. With feedback on your draft, you are ready to revise. You may need to return to an earlier step and make large-scale revisions that involve planning, organizing, and rewriting, or you may need to work mostly on ensuring that your sentences are clear and correct.</item>

      <title>Considering the Rhetorical Situation</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00003">Like other kinds of writing projects, a report starts with assessing the <term id="term-00006">rhetorical situation</term>—the circumstance in which a writer communicates with an audience of readers about a subject. As the writer of a report, you make choices based on the purpose of your writing, the audience who will read it, the genre of the report, and the expectations of the community and culture in which you are working.

      <title>Summary of Assignment</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00037">Write an analytical report on a topic that interests you and that you want to know more about. The topic can be contemporary or historical, but it must be one that you can analyze and support with evidence from sources.</para>
      <para id="para-00038">The following questions can help you think about a topic suitable for analysis:</para>
      <list list-type="enumerated" id="list-00003">
      <item>Why or how did ________ happen?</item>
      <item>What are the results or effects of ________?</item>
      <item>Is ________ a problem? If so, why?</item>
      <item>What are examples of ________ or reasons for ________?</item>
      <item>How does ________ compare to or contrast with other issues, concerns, or things?</item>
      </list>
      <para class="annotation visual-icon auditory-icon" id="para-00039">Consult and cite three to five reliable sources. The sources do not have to be scholarly for this assignment, but they must be credible, trustworthy, and unbiased. Possible sources include academic journals, newspapers, magazines, reputable websites, government publications or agency websites, and visual sources such as TED Talks. You may also use the results of an experiment or survey, and you may want to conduct interviews.</para>
      <para id="para-00040">Consider whether visuals and media will enhance your report. <emphasis effect="italics">Can you present data you collect visually? Would a map, photograph, chart, or other graphic provide interesting and relevant support? Would video or audio allow you to present evidence that you would otherwise need to describe in words?</emphasis></para>
      <para class="annotation culture-icon" id="para-00041"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens.</emphasis></emphasis> To gain another analytic view on the topic of your report, consider different people affected by it. Say, for example, that you have decided to report on recent high school graduates and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the final months of their senior year. If you are a recent high school graduate, you might naturally gravitate toward writing about yourself and your peers. But you might also consider the adults in the lives of recent high school graduates—for example, teachers, parents, or grandparents—and how they view the same period. Or you might consider the same topic from the perspective of a college admissions department looking at their incoming freshman class.</para>

      <title>Finding and Focusing a Topic</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00042">Coming up with a topic for a report can be daunting because you can report on nearly anything. The topic can easily get too broad, trapping you in the realm of generalizations. The trick is to find a topic that interests you and focus on an angle you can analyze in order to say something significant about it. You can use a graphic organizer to generate ideas, or you can use a concept map similar to the one featured in <link document="m00015">Writing Process: Thinking Critically About a “Text.”</link></para>
      <section id="sect-00006">
      <title>Asking the Journalist’s Questions</title>
      <para id="para-00043">One way to generate ideas about a topic is to ask the five W (and one H) questions, also called the <term id="term-00007">journalist’s questions</term>: <emphasis effect="italics">Who? What? When? Where? Why?</emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">How?</emphasis> Try answering the following questions to explore a topic:</para>
      <para id="para-00044"><emphasis effect="bold">Who</emphasis> was or is involved in ________?</para>
      <para id="para-00045"><emphasis effect="bold">What</emphasis> happened/is happening with ________? <emphasis effect="bold">What</emphasis> were/are the results of ________?</para>
      <para id="para-00046"><emphasis effect="bold">When</emphasis> did ________ happen? Is ________ happening now?</para>
      <para id="para-00047"><emphasis effect="bold">Where</emphasis> did ________ happen, or <emphasis effect="bold">where</emphasis> is ________ happening?</para>
      <para id="para-00048"><emphasis effect="bold">Why</emphasis> did ________ happen, or <emphasis effect="bold">why</emphasis> is ________ happening now?</para>
      <para id="para-00049"><emphasis effect="bold">How</emphasis> did ________ happen?</para>
      <para id="para-00050">For example, imagine that you have decided to write your analytical report on the effect of the COVID-19 shutdown on high-school students by interviewing students on your college campus.

      <entry>Everything was canceled from March through the end of the school year.

      <title>Asking Focused Questions</title>
      <para id="para-00054">Another way to find a topic is to ask focused questions about it. For example, you might ask the following questions about the effect of the 2020 pandemic shutdown on recent high school graduates:</para>
      <list id="list-00004">
      <item>How did the shutdown change students’ feelings about their senior year?</item>
      <item>How did the shutdown affect their decisions about post-graduation plans, such as work or going to college?</item>
      <item>How did the shutdown affect their academic performance in high school or in college?</item>

      <title>Gathering Information</title>
      <para id="para-00073">Because they are based on information and evidence, most analytical reports require you to do at least some research. Depending on your assignment, you may be able to find reliable information online, or you may need to do primary research by conducting an experiment, a survey, or interviews. For example, if you live among students in their late teens and early twenties, consider what they can tell you about their lives that you might be able to analyze. Returning to or graduating from high school, starting college, or returning to college in the midst of a global pandemic has provided them, for better or worse, with educational and social experiences that are shared widely by people their age and very different from the experiences older adults had at the same age.</para>
      <para id="para-00074">Some report assignments will require you to do formal research, an activity that involves finding sources and evaluating them for reliability, reading them carefully, taking notes, and citing all words you quote and ideas you borrow. See <link document="m00124">Research Process: Accessing and Recording Information</link> and <link document="m00131">Annotated Bibliography: Gathering, Evaluating, and Documenting Sources</link> for detailed instruction on conducting research.</para>
      <para id="para-00075">Whether you conduct in-depth research or not, keep track of the ideas that come to you and the information you learn. You can write or dictate notes using an app on your phone or computer, or you can jot notes in a journal if you prefer pen and paper. Then, when you are ready to begin organizing your report, you will have a record of your thoughts and information. Always track the sources of information you gather, whether from printed or digital material or from a person you interviewed, so that you can return to the sources if you need more information. And always credit the sources in your report.</para>
      <section id="sect-00009">
      <title>Kinds of Evidence</title>
      <para id="para-00076">Depending on your assignment and the topic of your report, certain kinds of evidence may be more effective than others. Other kinds of evidence may even be required. As a general rule, choose evidence that is rooted in verifiable facts and experience. In addition, select the evidence that best supports the topic and your approach to the topic, be sure the evidence meets your instructor’s requirements, and cite any evidence you use that comes from a source. The following list contains different kinds of frequently used evidence and an example of each.</para>

      <title>Drafting a Thesis</title>
      <para id="para-00093">When you have a grasp of your topic, move on to the next phase: drafting a thesis. The thesis is the central idea that you will explore and support in your report; all paragraphs in your report should relate to it. In an essay-style analytical report, you will likely express this main idea in a <term id="term-00017">thesis statement</term> of one or two sentences toward the end of the introduction.</para>
      <para id="para-00094">For example, if you found that the academic performance of student athletes was higher than that of non-athletes, you might write the following thesis statement:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00095"><emphasis effect="italics">Although a common stereotype is that college athletes barely pass their classes, an analysis of athletes’ academic performance indicates that athletes drop fewer classes, earn higher grades, and are more likely to be on track to graduate in four years when compared with their non-athlete peers.</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00096">The thesis statement often previews the organization of your writing. For example, in his report on the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Trevor Garcia wrote the following thesis statement, which detailed the central idea of his report:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00097"><emphasis effect="italics">An examination of the U.S. response shows that a reduction of experts in key positions and programs, inaction that led to equipment shortages, and inconsistent policies were three major causes of the spread of the virus and the resulting deaths.</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00098">After you draft a thesis statement, ask these questions, and examine your thesis as you answer them. Revise your draft as needed.</para>
      <list id="list-00006">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Is it interesting?</emphasis> A thesis for a report should answer a question that is worth asking and piques curiosity.</item>

      <title>Drafting an Analytical Report</title>
      <para id="para-00109">With a tentative thesis, an organization plan, and evidence, you are ready to begin drafting. For this assignment, you will report information, analyze it, and draw conclusions about the cause of something, the effect of something, or the similarities and differences between two different things.</para>
      <section id="sect-00014">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para id="para-00110">Some students write the introduction first; others save it for last. Whenever you choose to write the introduction, use it to draw readers into your report. Make the topic of your report clear, and be concise and sincere. End the introduction with your thesis statement. Depending on your topic and the type of report, you can write an effective introduction in several ways. Opening a report with an overview is a tried-and-true strategy, as shown in the following example on the U.S. response to COVID-19 by Trevor Garcia. Notice how he opens the introduction with statistics and a comparison and follows it with a question that leads to the thesis statement (underlined).</para>

      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00111">With more than 83 million cases and 1.8 million deaths at the end of 2020, COVID-19 has turned the world upside down. By the end of 2020, the United States led the world in the number of cases, at more than 20 million infections and nearly 350,000 deaths. In comparison, the second-highest number of cases was in India, which at the end of 2020 had less than half the number of COVID-19 cases despite having a population four times greater than the U.S. (“COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic,” 2021). How did the United States come to have the world’s worst record in this pandemic? <emphasis effect="underline">An examination of the U.S. response shows that a reduction of experts in key positions and programs, inaction that led to equipment shortages, and inconsistent policies were three major causes of the spread of the virus and the resulting deaths</emphasis>.</para>

      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00113">Betty stood outside the salon, wondering how to get in. It was June of 2020, and the door was locked. A sign posted on the door provided a phone number for her to call to be let in, but at 81, Betty had lived her life without a cell phone. Betty’s day-to-day life had been hard during the pandemic, but she had planned for this haircut and was looking forward to it; she had a mask on and hand sanitizer in her car. Now she couldn’t get in the door, and she was discouraged. In that moment, Betty realized how much Americans’ dependence on cell phones had grown in the months since the pandemic began. <emphasis effect="underline">Betty and thousands of other senior citizens who could not afford cell phones or did not have the technological skills and support they needed were being left behind in a society that was increasingly reliant on technology</emphasis>.</para>

      <title>Body Paragraphs: Point, Evidence, Analysis</title>
      <para id="para-00114">Use the body paragraphs of your report to present evidence that supports your thesis.

      <item>The <term id="term-00020">evidence</term> you provide develops the paragraph and supports the point made in the topic sentence. Include details, examples, quotations, paraphrases, and summaries from sources if you conducted formal research. Synthesize the evidence you include by showing in your sentences the connections between sources.</item>
      <item>The <term id="term-00021">analysis</term> comes at the end of the paragraph. In your own words, draw a conclusion about the evidence you have provided and how it relates to the topic sentence.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00115">The paragraph below illustrates the point, evidence, and analysis pattern. Drawn from a report about concussions among football players, the paragraph opens with a topic sentence about the NCAA and NFL and their responses to studies about concussions. The paragraph is developed with evidence from three sources. It concludes with a statement about helmets and players’ safety.</para>
      <quote id="quote-00003">
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00116">The NCAA and NFL have taken steps forward and backward to respond to studies about the danger of concussions among players. Responding to the deaths of athletes, documented brain damage, lawsuits, and public outcry (Buckley et al., 2017), the NCAA instituted protocols to reduce potentially dangerous hits during football games and to diagnose traumatic head injuries more quickly and effectively. Still, it has allowed players to wear more than one style of helmet during a season, raising the risk of injury because of imperfect fit. At the professional level, the NFL developed a helmet-rating system in 2011 in an effort to reduce concussions, but it continued to allow players to wear helmets with a wide range of safety ratings. The NFL’s decision created an opportunity for researchers to look at the relationship between helmet safety ratings and concussions. Cocello et al. (2016) reported that players who wore helmets with a lower safety rating had more concussions than players who wore helmets with a higher safety rating, and they concluded that safer helmets are a key factor in reducing concussions.</para>

      <title>Developing Paragraph Content</title>
      <para id="para-00117">In the body paragraphs of your report, you will likely use examples, draw comparisons, show contrasts, or analyze causes and effects to develop your topic.</para>
      <para id="para-00118">Paragraphs developed with <term id="term-00022">Example</term> are common in reports. The paragraph below, adapted from a report by student John Zwick on the mental health of soldiers deployed during wartime, draws examples from three sources.</para>
      <quote id="quote-00004">
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00119">Throughout the Vietnam War, military leaders claimed that the mental health of soldiers was stable and that men who suffered from combat fatigue, now known as PTSD, were getting the help they needed. For example, the <emphasis effect="italics">New York Times</emphasis> (1966) quoted military leaders who claimed that mental fatigue among enlisted men had “virtually ceased to be a problem,” occurring at a rate far below that of World War II. Ayres (1969) reported that Brigadier General Spurgeon Neel, chief American medical officer in Vietnam, explained that soldiers experiencing combat fatigue were admitted to the psychiatric ward, sedated for up to 36 hours, and given a counseling session with a doctor who reassured them that the rest was well deserved and that they were ready to return to their units. Although experts outside the military saw profound damage to soldiers’ psyches when they returned home (Halloran, 1970), the military stayed the course, treating acute cases expediently and showing little concern for the cumulative effect of combat stress on individual soldiers.</para>

      <para id="para-00120">When you analyze <term id="term-00023">causes and effects</term>, you explain the reasons that certain things happened and/or their results. The report by Trevor Garcia on the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is an example: his report examines the reasons the United States failed to control the coronavirus. The paragraph below, adapted from another student’s report written for an environmental policy course, explains the effect of white settlers’ views of forest management on New England.</para>
      <quote id="quote-00005">
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00121">The early colonists’ European ideas about forest management dramatically changed the New England landscape. White settlers saw the New World as virgin, unused land, even though indigenous people had been drawing on its resources for generations by using fire subtly to improve hunting, employing construction techniques that left ancient trees intact, and farming small, efficient fields that left the surrounding landscape largely unaltered. White settlers’ desire to develop wood-built and wood-burning homesteads surrounded by large farm fields led to forestry practices and techniques that resulted in the removal of old-growth trees. These practices defined the way the forests look today.</para>

      <para id="para-00122"><term id="term-00024">Compare and contrast</term> paragraphs are useful when you wish to examine similarities and differences. You can use both comparison and contrast in a single paragraph, or you can use one or the other. The paragraph below, adapted from a student report on the rise of populist politicians, compares the rhetorical styles of populist politicians Huey Long and Donald Trump.</para>
      <quote id="quote-00006">
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00123">A key similarity among populist politicians is their rejection of carefully crafted sound bites and erudite vocabulary typically associated with candidates for high office. Huey Long and Donald Trump are two examples. When he ran for president, Long captured attention through his wild gesticulations on almost every word, dramatically varying volume, and heavily accented, folksy expressions, such as “The only way to be able to feed the balance of the people is to make that man come back and bring back some of that grub that he ain’t got no business with!” In addition, Long’s down-home persona made him a credible voice to represent the common people against the country’s rich, and his buffoonish style allowed him to express his radical ideas without sounding anti-communist alarm bells. Similarly, Donald Trump chose to speak informally in his campaign appearances, but the persona he projected was that of a fast-talking, domineering salesman. His frequent use of personal anecdotes, rhetorical questions, brief asides, jokes, personal attacks, and false claims made his speeches disjointed, but they gave the feeling of a running conversation between him and his audience. For example, in a 2015 speech, Trump said, “They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don’t have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should’ve taken” (“Our Country Needs” 2020). While very different in substance, Long and Trump adopted similar styles that positioned them as the antithesis of typical politicians and their worldviews.</para>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <para id="para-00124">The conclusion should draw the threads of your report together and make its significance clear to readers. You may wish to review the introduction, restate the thesis, recommend a course of action, point to the future, or use some combination of these. Whichever way you approach it, the conclusion should not head in a new direction. The following example is the conclusion from a student’s report on the effect of a book about environmental movements in the United States.</para>
      <quote id="quote-00007">
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00125">Since its publication in 1949, environmental activists of various movements have found wisdom and inspiration in Aldo Leopold’s <emphasis effect="italics">A Sand County Almanac</emphasis>. These audiences included Leopold’s conservationist contemporaries, environmentalists of the 1960s and 1970s, and the environmental justice activists who rose in the 1980s and continue to make their voices heard today. These audiences have read the work differently: conservationists looked to the author as a leader, environmentalists applied his wisdom to their movement, and environmental justice advocates have pointed out the flaws in Leopold’s thinking. Even so, like those before them, environmental justice activists recognize the book’s value as a testament to taking the long view and eliminating biases that may cloud an objective assessment of humanity’s interdependent relationship with the environment.</para>

      <title>Using Reviewers’ Responses to Revise your Work</title>

Try not to get defensive, even though this response is completely natural. Remember that readers are like coaches who want you to succeed. They are looking at your writing from outside your own head, and they can identify strengths and weaknesses that you may not have noticed. Keep track of the strengths and weaknesses your readers point out. Pay special attention to those that more than one reader identifies, and use this information to improve your report and later assignments.</para>
      <para id="para-00142">As you analyze each response, be open to suggestions for improvement, and be willing to make significant revisions to improve your writing. Perhaps you need to revise your thesis statement to better reflect the content of your draft. Maybe you need to return to your sources to better understand a point you’re trying to make in order to develop a paragraph more fully. Perhaps you need to rethink the organization, move paragraphs around, and add transition sentences.</para>
      <para id="para-00143">Below is an early draft of part of Trevor Garcia’s report with comments from a peer reviewer:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00144">To truly understand what happened, it’s important first to look back to the years leading up to the pandemic. Epidemiologists and public health officials had long known that a global pandemic was possible. In 2016, the U.S. National Security Council (NSC) published a 69-page document with the intimidating title <emphasis effect="italics">Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents</emphasis>. The document’s two sections address responses to “emerging disease threats that start or are circulating in another country but not yet confirmed within U.S. territorial borders” and to “emerging disease threats within our nation’s borders.” On 13 January 2017, the joint Obama-Trump transition teams performed a pandemic preparedness exercise; however, the playbook was never adopted by the incoming administration.</para>

      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00146"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Peer Review Comment:</emphasis></emphasis> I’m getting lost in the details about the playbook. What’s the Obama-Trump transition team?</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00147">In February 2018, the administration began to cut funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; cuts to other health agencies continued throughout 2018, with funds diverted to unrelated projects such as housing for detained immigrant children.</para>
      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00148"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Peer Review Comment:</emphasis></emphasis> This paragraph has only one sentence, and it’s more like an example. It needs a topic sentence and more development.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00149">Three months later, Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, spoke at a symposium marking the centennial of the 1918 influenza pandemic. “The threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,” she said. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.”</para>
      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00150"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Peer Review Comment:</emphasis></emphasis> This paragraph is very short and a lot like the previous paragraph in that it’s a single example. It needs a topic sentence. Maybe you can combine them?</para>
      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00151"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Peer Review Comment:</emphasis></emphasis> Be sure to cite the quotation.</para>
      <para id="para-00152">Reading these comments and those of others, Trevor decided to combine the three short paragraphs into one paragraph focusing on the fact that the United States knew a pandemic was possible but was unprepared for it. He developed the paragraph, using the short paragraphs as evidence and connecting the sentences and evidence with transitional words and phrases. Finally, he added in-text citations in APA documentation style to credit his sources. The revised paragraph is below:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00153">Epidemiologists and public health officials in the United States had long known that a global pandemic was possible. In 2016, the National Security Council (NSC) published <emphasis effect="italics">Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents</emphasis>, a 69-page document on responding to diseases spreading within and outside of the United States. On January 13, 2017, the joint transition teams of outgoing president Barack Obama and then president-elect Donald Trump performed a pandemic preparedness exercise based on the playbook; however, it was never adopted by the incoming administration (Goodman &amp; Schulkin, 2020). A year later, in February 2018, the Trump administration began to cut funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leaving key positions unfilled. Other individuals who were fired or resigned in 2018 were the homeland security adviser, whose portfolio included global pandemics; the director for medical and biodefense preparedness; and the top official in charge of a pandemic response. None of them were replaced, leaving the White House with no senior person who had experience in public health (Goodman &amp; Schulkin, 2020). Experts voiced concerns, among them Luciana Borio, director of medical and biodefense preparedness at the NSC, who spoke at a symposium marking the centennial of the 1918 influenza pandemic in May 2018: “The threat of pandemic flu is the number one health security concern,” she said. “Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no” (Sun, 2018, final para.).</para>
