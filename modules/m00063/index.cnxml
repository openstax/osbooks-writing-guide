      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00003">Like other kinds of writing projects, a proposal starts with assessing the <term id="term-00006">rhetorical situation</term>—the circumstance in which a writer communicates with an audience of readers about a subject.

      <section id="sect-00003">
      <title>Summary of Assignment</title>
      <para id="para-00016">Write a proposal that discusses a problem you want to learn more about and that recommends a solution. The problem you choose must be a current problem, even though it may have been a problem for many years. The problem must also affect many people, and it must have an actual solution or solutions that you can learn about through research. In other words, the problem cannot be unique to you, and the solution you recommend cannot be one you only imagine; both the problem and the solution must be grounded in reality.</para>
      <para id="para-00017">One way to get ideas about a problem to write about is to read a high-quality newspaper, website, or social media account for a week. Read widely on whatever platform you choose so that you learn what people are saying, what a newspaper’s editorial board is taking a stand on, what opinion writers are making cases for in op-eds, and what community members are commenting on. You’ll begin to get a handle on problems in your community or state that people care about. If you read a paper or website with a national or international audience, you’ll learn about problems that affect people in other places.</para>
      <para id="para-00018">You will need to consult and cite at least five reliable sources. They can be scholarly, but they do not have to be. They must be credible, trustworthy, and unbiased. Possible sources include articles from reputable newspapers, magazines, and academic and professional journals; reputable websites; government sources; and visual sources. Depending on your topic, you may want to conduct a survey, an interview, or an experiment. See <link document="m00124">Research Process: Accessing and Recording Information</link> and <link document="m00131">Annotated Bibliography: Gathering, Evaluating, and Documenting Sources</link> for information about creating and finding sources. Your proposal can include a visual or media source if it provides appropriate, relevant evidence.</para>
      <para class="annotation culture-icon" id="para-00019"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens.</emphasis></emphasis> Another way to approach a proposal assignment is to consider problems that affect you directly and affect others. Perhaps you are concerned about running up student loan debt. Or perhaps you worry about how to pay your rent while earning minimum wage. These concerns are valid and affect many college students around the United States. Another way is to think about problems that affect others. Perhaps students in your class or on your campus have backgrounds and experiences that differ from yours—<emphasis effect="italics">what problems or challenges might they have encountered during their time in college that you don’t know about?</emphasis></para>
      <para id="para-00020">As you think about the purpose and audience for your proposal, think again about the rhetorical situation, specifically about the audience you want to reach and the mode of presentation best suited to them and your purpose. For example, say you’re dissatisfied with the process for electing student leaders on your campus. If your purpose is to identify the problems in the process and propose a change, then your audience would include other students, the group or committee that oversees student elections, and perhaps others. To reach other students who might also be dissatisfied, you might write an article, editorial, or letter for the campus newspaper, social media page, or website, depending on how students on your campus get news. In addition, you might organize a meeting of other students to get their input on the problem. To reach the decision makers, which may include elected students, faculty, and administrators, you might need to prepare an oral presentation and a slide deck.</para>

      <title>Finding a Problem to Write About</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00022">A proposal must address a real-life problem and present one or more workable solutions. Usually, problems worth writing about are not easily solved; if they were, they would no longer be considered problems. Indeed, problems in proposals are often complex, and solutions are often complicated and involve trade-offs. Sometimes people disagree about whether the problem is a problem at all and whether any proposed solutions are viable solutions.</para>

      <title>Exploring a Problem</title>
      <para id="para-00023">One way to generate ideas about a problem is to brainstorm. To explore a topic for your proposal, use a graphic organizer like <link target-id="table-00002" document="m00063"/> to write responses to the following statements and questions:</para>

      <entry>How I know data breaches are a problem…</entry>
      <entry>In my class, we’re spending a lot of time on data security and breaches. Also, data breaches are in the news almost constantly, and a Google search turns up many that don’t make the news.</entry>
      </row>
      <row>
      <entry>What are a few examples of data breaches?</entry>
      <entry>I’ve heard about people getting their information stolen. I’ve heard about foreign governments, like Russia, stealing national security information and trying to interfere in recent elections. In my class, I’m learning about businesses that have customer and employee information stolen.</entry>

      <row>
      <entry>Who is affected by data breaches?</entry>
      <entry>Individual people, businesses, utility companies, schools and universities, governments (local, state, and national)—pretty much anyone can be affected.</entry>
      </row>
      <row>
      <entry>What are some negative effects of data breaches?</entry>
      <entry>Identity theft, financial theft, national security, power shutdowns, and election interference. Data breaches cause chaos and cost a lot of money.</entry>
      </row>
      <row>
      <entry>Why should the problem of data breaches be solved?</entry>
      <entry>People need the personal, financial, and medical information they share with businesses and other organizations to remain private. Businesses and organizations need to keep their operations secure. Governments need to keep national security secrets from getting into the hands of people who want to harm them.</entry>
      </row>
      <row>
      <entry>What are the potential consequences of data breaches if nothing is done?</entry>
      <entry>People will continue to be victims of identity theft and all that goes with it, including losing money, and they will lose trust in institutions they used to trust, like banks, hospitals, and the government.</entry>
      </row>
      <row>
      <entry>What are some realistic solutions to data breaches?</entry>
      <entry>Increased security for individuals, like two-factor authentication, stronger passwords, and education to avoid getting scammed. For companies and governments, stronger protections on websites. I need to learn more.</entry>

      <title>Gathering Information</title>
      <para id="para-00028">Proposals are rooted in information and evidence; therefore, most proposal assignments require you to conduct research. Depending on your assignment, you may need to do formal research, an activity that involves finding sources and evaluating them for reliability, reading them carefully and taking notes, and citing all words you quote and ideas you borrow. See <link document="m00124">Research Process: Accessing and Recording Information</link> and <link document="m00131">Annotated Bibliography: Gathering, Evaluating, and Documenting Sources</link> for detailed instruction on conducting research. If you are proposing a solution to a problem in your local community or on your campus, you may need to conduct primary research as well, such as a survey or interviews with people who live or work there.</para>
      <para id="para-00029">Whether you conduct in-depth research or do background reading, keep track of the ideas that come to you and the information you learn. You can write or dictate notes using an app on your phone or computer, or you can jot notes in a journal if you prefer pen and paper. Then, when you are ready to begin to organize what you have learned, you will have a record of your thoughts and information. Always track the source of the information you gather, whether from your reading or a person you interviewed, so that you can return to that source if you need more information and can credit the source in your paper.</para>

      <para id="para-00047">When you have a solid grasp of the problem and solution, try drafting a <term id="term-00018">thesis</term>. A thesis is the main idea that you will convey in your proposal and to which all the paragraphs in the paper should relate.

      <title>Body Paragraphs: Problem</title>
      <para id="para-00068">Follow the introduction with a discussion of the problem. Using paragraph structure, define the problem and discuss it, drawing on evidence from your sources. This paragraph (or paragraphs) should answer these questions: <emphasis effect="italics">What is the problem? Why is this a problem?</emphasis> The following example, from the proposal on women working in IT, answers the first question:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00069">The information technology (IT) field is continuously expanding, with many more positions available than workers to fill them. In fact, the pool of IT professionals was so small that in 2001, Congress raised the visa limit in an effort to fill the gap with employees from overseas (Varma, 2002). And yet the number of women represented in the occupation is decreasing. From 1990 to 2020, the percentage of women in IT declined from 31 percent to 25 percent, even though women make up 47 percent of all employed adults in the United States. According to White (2021), only 19 percent of women pursue a computer science major in college, compared to 27 percent in 1997. Of those women who graduated with a computer science degree, 38 percent are working in the field compared to 56 percent of men, a statistic that indicates women are not staying in the field. Although gender diversity supposedly is valued in the workplace, the underrepresentation of women in IT is clearly a problem.</para>
      <para id="para-00070">The writer then goes on to answer the second question: <emphasis effect="italics">Why is this a problem?</emphasis> The writer discusses stereotypes, lack of encouragement and role models, workplace culture, pay, and prospects for advancement (not shown here).</para>
      </section>
      <section id="sect-00018">
      <title>Body Paragraphs: Solutions</title>
      <para id="para-00071">After presenting and explaining the problem, use specific information from the sources you consulted to present the solution or solutions you have discovered through your research. If you are proposing more than one solution, present them one at a time, using headings as appropriate.</para>
      <para id="para-00072">The solutions section will likely be the longest part of your proposal. Below are two paragraphs from the proposal about women working in IT. Note how the first paragraph introduces the solutions and how the second paragraph uses evidence to develop the first proposed solution. Also note the informative boldface headings.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00073">The following suggestions are ways to encourage women to enter IT and build their careers, with the eventual goal of achieving gender balance in the field. The solutions discussed include encouraging interest in computer technology among girls in middle school and high school, actively recruiting college-age women to study IT, and within the field, mentoring women and expanding workplace flexibility to improve retention.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00074">The National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) is an organization that encourages girls in middle school and high school to explore their interest in IT. One program, the NCWIT’s Aspirations in Computing, supports women in high school by showing them that they can succeed in technology and introducing them to other students with similar interests. The same program matches middle-school girls with female high-school and college students and awards scholarships for computing and programming competitions. In addition, internships and IT courses in middle school and high school provide opportunities to learn what a career in IT entails, with or without a degree in IT. Opportunities like these give girls and women support and a sense of belonging.</para>
      <para id="para-00075">The paragraphs that follow (not shown here) continue the discussion of the possible solutions.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="sect-00021">
      <title>Body Paragraphs: Objections</title>
      <para id="para-00076">Depending on the problem and solution, consider the objections readers may raise, and explain why your proposal is necessary and worthwhile. For example, the proposal on women in IT does not discuss objections because few people would object to the writer’s proposal. Shawn Krukowski, however, in his proposal on climate change, includes a section on objections to taking action. He focuses the discussion on people who deny that climate change is a problem. <emphasis effect="italics">Would you do the same?</emphasis> Consider whether this section of Shawn’s proposal might have been stronger had he addressed objections to the solutions he proposed—mitigation and adaptation—instead of objections to the problem.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00077">Despite scientific evidence, some people and groups deny that climate change is real or, if they admit it exists, insist it is not a valid concern. Those who think climate change is not a problem point to Earth’s millennia-long history of changing climate as evidence that life has always persisted. Most of the change, however, predates human civilization, which has benefited from thousands of years of stable climate. The rapid change since the Industrial Revolution is unprecedented in human history.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00078">Those who deny climate change or its dangers seek primarily to relax or remove pollution standards and regulations in order to protect, or maximize profit from, their industries. To date, their lobbying has been successful. For example, the world’s fossil-fuel industry received $5.3 trillion in 2015 alone, while the U.S. wind-energy industry received $12.3 billion in subsidies between 2000 and 2020 (Green America, 2020).</para>

      <section id="sect-00023">
      <title>Conclusion and Recommendation</title>
      <para id="para-00079">The conclusion and recommendation section of your proposal is the part in which you interpret your findings and make a recommendation or give a call to action. At this point, focus on the solution that will best solve the problem, suggesting or summarizing specific actions.</para>
      <para id="para-00080">Below is the recommendation section from the proposal about women in IT. In the full conclusion (not shown here), the writer summarizes the main points of the proposal. In the recommendation paragraph that follows, the writer calls for specific actions:</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00081">Many researchers have studied why few women choose IT as a career and why some decide to leave the field. Although the numbers cannot be improved immediately, the following changes in school and the workplace could recruit and retain more women in IT:</para>
      <list id="list-00007">
      <item>Include technology education courses and formal IT programs in middle- and high-school curricula to give girls and young women opportunities to develop an interest at an early age.</item>
      <item>Develop internship and mentor programs in high schools and colleges to combat stereotyping and encourage women to enter the field.</item>
      <item>Develop and encourage workplace mentor programs, flexible work options, and open communication for professional growth and retention.</item>
      </list>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00082">With time and effort, these actions may result in more women seeing themselves in long-term IT careers.</para>

      <title>References or Works Cited Page</title>
      <para id="para-00083">Including any data you gathered through primary research, such as a survey you created and administered, interviews you conducted, or observational notes you took, you must cite the sources you consulted. These sources appear in the text of your proposal and in a bibliography at the end. The paragraphs in the previous section, including Shawn Krukowski’s proposal, use APA documentation style.

      <section id="sect-00025">
      <title>Abstract or Executive Summary</title>
      <para id="para-00084">An abstract (or executive summary) summarizes your proposal. The purpose is to present information briefly and economically so that readers can decide whether they want to read further. Include your main points, but not the evidence.</para>
      <para id="para-00085">Although an abstract or executive summary comes first in a proposal, it is advisable to write it after you have completed your proposal and are certain of your main points. The example below is the abstract from the proposal about women in IT.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00086">The purpose of this proposal is to raise awareness of the small number of women working in the information technology (IT) field, to examine the factors that contribute to discouraging women from entering IT, and to propose ways to draw women into the field and retain them. Although the IT field is growing, the number of women employed within it remains low. Women may be reluctant to pursue a career in IT because of stereotypes, few role models, and lack of encouragement. Women who have already established a career in IT report leaving the field for these reasons, as well as family responsibilities and lack of advancement. There are several potential ways to raise the number of women in IT. Encouraging interest in computer technology among girls in middle school and high school, recruiting college-age women to study IT, mentoring young professional women, and improving workplace flexibility will, over time, break down stereotypes and increase the number of women in the IT field.</para>

      <title>Responding to Reviewers’ Feedback</title>
      <para id="para-00092">When you receive feedback from readers—whether from your instructor, your classmates, a writing tutor, or someone else—read each comment carefully to understand what the reader is communicating. Do your best not to become defensive, and be open to suggestions for improvement. Remind yourself that your readers are trying to help. As someone who hasn’t thought about your proposal as much as you have, a new reader can often see strengths and weaknesses that you cannot. Analyze each response, and decide whether acting on a suggestion will make your writing better. Remember that you remain the author, and you make the final call on your writing.</para>

      <title>Revising on Your Own</title>
      <para id="para-00094">The following revising strategies can help you read your draft critically and carefully:</para>
      <list id="list-00008">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Read your draft aloud.</emphasis> Read the entire text from the beginning slowly and carefully, marking spots that need revision. Reading in this way allows you to see areas that need clarification, explanation, or development that you may have missed when you wrote the first draft. You can also have someone read your draft aloud to you.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Make a paragraph outline.</emphasis> The most common unit of thought in writing is the paragraph, a group of sentences set off from other groups because they focus on a single idea. Writing a paragraph outline creates a map of your whole paper that can help you determine whether the organization is effective or needs changing. Number each paragraph and write a phrase describing its topic or focus. Check that each paragraph has a topic sentence that states the main idea of the paragraph.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Test your evidence.</emphasis> Check whether each piece of evidence is factual and supports the main idea of the paragraph. Check that each piece of evidence is introduced, woven into your sentences, and cited.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Listen for your voice.</emphasis> In most college papers, your language should sound like a real person. If your instructor requires a formal style for the assignment, the language should be objective and in <term id="term-00027">third-person point of view</term>.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Let go if you need to.</emphasis> View change as good. Learn to let go of words, sentences, paragraphs, and maybe even your entire first draft. Sometimes the best way to revise is to start fresh. The knowledge you have built in writing a first draft will serve you well if you need to start over.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Create a new file for each revision.</emphasis> Each time you revise a draft, save the new version with a new file name so that you don’t lose your previous work. That way, you can return to an earlier version of your draft if you are not happy with the revision.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Edit and proofread.</emphasis> When you are satisfied with the overall shape of your paper, reread it once again to check for sentence-level errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, and source citations.</item>
