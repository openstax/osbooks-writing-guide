      <title>Summary of Assignment: A Profile in Courage or Other Admirable Trait</title>
      <para id="para-00003">For this assignment, you will develop an essay that profiles the courage—or another admirable aspect—of someone or something associated with your college campus. You will create a profile of a person, group, place, or event that exemplifies the admirable aspect as you define it. For your profile, you will conduct the specific kinds of research done by profile writers: interviews, field research, and secondary research from credible sources.</para>
      <para id="para-00004">Once you have compiled your research, you will decide on the focus and angle of your piece, then plan and develop your draft. You will also participate in peer review to receive guidance for any needed revisions. Throughout the process, you will focus on developing an essay that shows readers how your subject exemplifies the admirable trait you have chosen.</para>
      <para id="para-00005"><emphasis effect="bold"><emphasis effect="italics">Another Lens.</emphasis></emphasis> Another option for this assignment is a group writing project for your class or smaller groups within the class. Your instructor will decide whether the project will be completed by the whole class or smaller groups. With your peers, you will write a collaborative profile in courage of your class or group as a whole, showing how you all exemplify courage together. All students will contribute anecdotes about courage from their own lives in addition to conducting all other research on which profiles are based. The class or group will then work together to organize, draft, revise, edit, and proofread the collective composition.</para>
      <section id="sect-00004">
      <title>Defining the Admirable Trait</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00006">Before beginning your profile, choose the admirable trait on which you will focus, and then create your own definition of it. This definition will help you select your subject and focus your research. Consider including the definition in your final product as well.</para>
      <para id="para-00007">First, to decide on the trait, follow these steps:</para>
      <list id="list-00002">
      <item>Set a timer for five minutes. During that time, write or record a comprehensive list of traits you admire in other people. Include a wide range of possibilities, such as “humor,” “generosity,” “patience,” and so on. To generate a robust list, think also of the people you admire, and then pinpoint the attributes you admire about them.</item>
      <item>Consider all of the traits you have listed, and select one to focus on for this project.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00008">Next, use one or more of the following methods to begin defining the aspect of the subject that you admire:</para>
      <list id="list-00003">
      <item>Think about the admirable trait you have chosen, and write down a few words or phrases that you associate with it.</item>
      <item>Assemble a collage of images that make you think of the admirable trait.</item>
      <item>Write brief notes about moments when you have personally shown the trait you are focusing on—or about times you have seen others exhibit this trait.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00009">Looking at all of these notes, write your personal definition of the admirable trait. Your draft definition will probably evolve as you develop your profile. If so, great! That means you have been thinking more about the idea. Here is a sample definition of an admirable trait: <emphasis effect="italics">Kindness is grace in action; it shows itself when people are willing to truly listen to others and to understand the world from another vantage point. People embody kindness when they choose to respond gently rather than angrily or when they help others without complaining.</emphasis></para>
      </section>
      <section id="sect-00005">
      <title>Choosing a Subject</title>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00010">Now that you have a working definition of the trait you are using to focus your profile, you can choose your subject. Members of the campus community are usually willing subjects: professors, librarians, resident assistants, alumni, staff, and coaches, to name a few. You might also consider buildings, public spaces, or public art on campus. In addition, the local community may contain potential subjects—for example, business owners, city administrators, and other local individuals, groups, or events peripherally associated with your school. Also consider discussing your project with an archivist if one is available on campus or in your community; these specialist librarians always have interesting subjects to recommend for research. Follow these steps to choose a subject:</para>
      <list id="list-00004">
      <item>Jot down notes about intriguing buildings, public spaces, pieces of public art, people, events, and groups on or near campus.</item>
      <item>Do a quick online search—perhaps on the campus website—to see what information is available about several potential subjects that most intrigue you. Remember that this research is simply to narrow your options; you will conduct more careful and thorough research after making your final choice.</item>
      <item>Having gathered preliminary information, think about which potential subject best connects to the definition of the admirable trait you have developed. Also, think about which subject most interests you.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00011">Now weigh the factors you have considered here, and choose the subject you would most like to pursue. If you are having trouble choosing between two subjects, discuss your options with your instructor or with someone in the campus writing center. Once you have chosen a subject, you can plan your research. You will need to schedule interviews, field observations, and time for secondary research before you begin organizing your findings and drafting your paper.</para>

      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00012">Profile writers learn as much about their subjects as possible. Be sure to take advantage of all available sources of information, and follow up on new leads wherever you find them. After completing your research, you will be able to refine your angle and draft your piece. As you gather your research, keep your target audience in mind, and look for details about your subject that will interest them. For example, Carla D. Hayden included information about events in which John Lewis participated at the Library of Congress. These details would interest Library of Congress blog readers, the audience for this piece.</para>

      <title>Interviews</title>
      <para id="para-00041">Talking with your subject—or a professional who knows a great deal about your subject—is often the best place to start your research. Interviews generally fall into the category of <term id="term-00006">primary research</term>, or research you collect directly for yourself. Try to interview your profile subject directly if the subject is a person. You also may find interviews with or about your subject that journalists have completed and published, though these would not be primary research. If you are unable to interview your subject directly, try to interview someone who has credible information about your subject; such interviews would be primary research as well. People who know, live, and work with your subject can provide additional, helpful background information. Try to set up a few short interviews with these people to deepen your insights.</para>
      <para class="annotation dreaming-icon" id="para-00042">The easiest way to conduct an interview is to schedule a brief, informal conversation in a comfortable setting. For a successful interview, have questions prepared and be ready to take notes as you talk. Following in <link target-id="table-00003" document="m00053"/> are sample questions you might ask. To add to this list, think about your preliminary research as well as the definition of the admirable trait you are using for your profile.</para>
      <para id="para-00043">Note that you will need to cite any interviews you conduct, both within the text and in the Works Cited list. The Works Cited entry for an interview will read as follows:</para>

      <title>Thick Description</title>
      <para class="annotation kinesthetic-icon" id="para-00047">Another form of primary research is field observation. If at all possible, observe your subject in their element—watch them (with permission!) during their workday, spend an extended period of time in a related space, or watch available videos of your subject. In all cases, take thorough and detailed notes to create a <term id="term-00007">thick description</term>, or a careful record of every sensory detail you can capture—smells, sounds, sights, textures, physical sensations, and perhaps tastes. This thick description can provide meaningful details to illuminate the points in your piece. Meticulously record all sensory information about your subject and their setting, writing in-depth notes about what you see, smell, hear, feel, and taste. Remember to use words that express size, shape, color, texture, and sound. If you are taking notes on a person, describe their clothing, gestures, and physical characteristics. At the same time, take note of the interview setting. If the interview takes place in a neutral space, the setting can provide a backdrop for the profile. If the interview setting is a person’s room or apartment, record the details that tell the most about your subject’s special interests.

      <para id="para-00052">Profile writers supplement their primary research findings through <term id="term-00008">secondary research</term>, or research that others have completed and published. Ensure that any supplemental information you use comes from <term id="term-00009">credible sources</term>; these include peer-reviewed journals for academic sources and well-established, highly regarded organizations for public, nonacademic ones. Keep careful records of this research so that you can cite each source appropriately. Use the tools available from the <link url="https://openstax.org/r/modernlanguage">Modern Language Association</link> and in <link document="m00124">Research Process: Accessing and Recording Information</link> and <link document="m00131">Annotated Bibliography: Gathering, Evaluating, and Documenting Sources</link> for guidance in researching and managing source material.

      <para id="para-00053">Additionally, ask your subject for their résumé and any writing samples they may have developed. While this type of research may not be available about your subject, as many ordinary people have not published anything, find and read any existing publications by or about your subject. Additionally, you can focus your secondary research on information related to your subject rather than about your subject specifically. For example, Carla D. Hayden, in writing the profile of John Lewis, could have researched Bloody Sunday more generally, or she could have found secondary research about the AIDS quilt to which she refers.

      <title>Finalizing and Supporting Your Angle</title>
      <para id="para-00057">Remember that the writing process is <term id="term-00011">recursive</term>, meaning you will move back and forth among the steps in the process multiple times rather than progress through each step only once. For example, you may decide to conduct a bit more research while you are drafting or after you have received feedback from peer review. To include this new research, you may need to rearrange the structure of your draft. As you draft, keep focused on your angle at all times. Losing focus and including irrelevant material may weaken your profile and cause readers to lose interest in the subject.</para>
      <section id="sect-00014">
      <title>Organization</title>
      <para id="para-00058">As discussed in <link document="m00051">Glance at Genre: Subject, Angle, Background, and Description</link>, profiles can be organized in several ways: chronologically, spatially, or topically. Review the information you inserted in reponse to <link target-id="table-00001" document="m00053"/>, along with your admirable trait definition, to decide which organizational strategy would work best for your piece. Then use the following sections to organize the introduction, body, and conclusion of your work. When organizing your draft, think about where to place each piece of information to convey your points most effectively. Rather than using a strict chronological structure throughout your draft, you may find your piece is more effective if you begin with a topical structure and then provide some information chronologically.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="sect-00015">
      <title>Introduction and Thesis</title>
      <para id="para-00059">Like introductions in most of the writing you do, the profile introduction establishes some background and context for readers to understand your main point. Think about what readers need to know in order to appreciate your angle, and include that information in the introduction. Some writers prefer to compose their introductions first, whereas others wait until after they have developed a draft of the body. Whichever strategy you use, be sure that the introduction engages readers so that they want to continue reading. Refer to the sample texts in this chapter for models of introductory texts.</para>
      <para id="para-00060">Remember, too, that your thesis should appear as the last sentence, or close to the end, of the introduction. For the profile, your thesis would be a sentence or two explaining your angle. For example:</para>
      <list id="list-00012">
      <item>[Name of subject] showed [the admirable trait] not only in [doing something that shows the trait] but even more so by refusing to [accept or participate in something].</item>
      <item>[Name of subject] plays a unique part in the [history, life, culture] of [place, group] because [reason for angle].</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00061">Try one of these models, or a variation of it, as the first draft of your thesis.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="sect-00016">
      <title>Body Paragraphs</title>
      <para id="para-00062">Each body paragraph should support the angle you have taken, advancing your thesis, or main point. For suggestions on developing body paragraphs in narrative writing, see <link document="m00028">Literacy Narrative: Building Bridges, Bridging Gaps</link> and <link document="m00038">Memoir or Personal Narrative: Learning Lessons from the Personal</link>. For each paragraph, synthesize details—examples, anecdotes, quotations, location, background information, or descriptions of events—from more than one source to support your angle. By including all of these elements, necessary explanations, and a combination of narrative and reporting, you will create the strongest possible profile piece. See the section <link document="m00056">See the section Spotlight on . . . Profiling a Cultural Artifact</link> to explore examples of how these elements can work in the paragraphs of a blog post profiling a cultural artifact. In each paragraph, consider drawing on the following:</para>
      <list id="list-00013">
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Show and Tell.</emphasis> In balancing between interviews and biographies, profile writers use both narrative and reporting techniques—that is, they both show and tell readers information about the subject. As you read your notes, decide which elements you will use to show readers something about your subject and which elements you will simply report.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Quoted Material.</emphasis> If your subject has said something in a memorable way, present their words directly to readers. Doing so increases your readers’ sense of the subject’s voice.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Anecdotes.</emphasis> Very brief scenarios or stories about something your subject has done, or about the subject itself, contribute to readers’ understanding. Often, anecdotes reflect field research, showing the subject “in action” or reflecting what others think about the subject. For example, Carla D. Hayden relates anecdotes about John Lewis’s actions leading 600 protesters in Selma, Alabama.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Background Information.</emphasis> You may have one or more paragraphs in which you present background information—but only information that is relevant to the profile. If you highlight an individual’s success or their contributions to society or a cause, then that person’s humble beginnings may be relevant as a contrast. Hayden mentions Lewis’s impoverished youth for this reason. Including background information helps readers place the subject in time and within their culture.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Location.</emphasis> Placing your subject in a setting, in either the past or the present, helps readers understand and visualize the subject in a particular context. Be sure to include location in at least one body paragraph.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="para-00063">The sample texts in this chapter provide models for you to use when developing your draft. Use a graphic organizer like <link target-id="table-00006" document="m00053"/> to identify the following profile genre elements in one or more of the model texts featured in this chapter: <link document="m00052">Annotated Sample Reading</link>, the student sample in this section, or <link document="m00056">Spotlight on … Profiling a Cultural Artifact</link>.

      <para id="para-00064">Additionally, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">tone</term>, a writer’s attitude toward their subject, is particularly important in profiles because it conveys authenticity to readers. If you praise a subject but your tone or attitude reflects detachment or lack of interest, readers will notice the discrepancy. Hayden’s attitude toward her subject, John Lewis, is one of respect and admiration. If you are writing about someone courageous, then your tone will probably be similar to hers. Remember, though, that you are the narrator, and thus you set the tone. If you insert quotations by people who don’t think as you do, make sure that doing so suits your purpose. By including information in the areas covered above and maintaining a consistent and appropriate tone, you will have the basis of a strong and engaging profile.</para>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <para id="para-00065">The conclusion is your opportunity to pull all the points of the essay together. Many writers like to restate the main point they have sustained throughout the essay in the conclusion. Another strong move for the conclusion is to tell readers the <term id="term-00013">exigency</term> of the piece—in other words, why the information is important and why they should care about it. After your introduction and body are complete, read through your draft; this process will often give you a sense of what still needs to be said in the conclusion.

Think about whether you need to break some sentences apart or combine some sentences for smoother flow.

Read your composition aloud to see whether you overuse some words. Edit your work as needed.</item>
      <item><emphasis effect="bold">Proofread.</emphasis> After editing, read through a third time with an eye on small details to proofread your work.

      <title>Revised Draft Profile Sample</title>
      <para id="para-00078">This section provides one example of a revised profile draft written by a first-year college student. As you will read, the admirable quality that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Houston Byrd</term> focuses on in this essay is that his subject, a bricks-and-mortar video store, offers “a crucial and important service to its community.” You will also see the ways in which Byrd both “shows and tells” readers about his subject, offering information drawn from each type of required research: interview, field observation, and secondary sources. Byrd has chosen to insert himself and his experiences of his subject fully into this profile. Review <link document="m00051">Glance at Genre: Subject, Angle, Background, and Description</link>, and then read Byrd’s essay to see how well he incorporates the narrative and reporting profile genre elements in his draft.</para>
      <para id="para-00079">After Byrd received peer feedback, he decided that his previous draft did not need much revision; he was happy with his structure, and the organization made sense to his readers. One peer suggested that Byrd insert topic sentences in each paragraph, but he ultimately decided not to do so because he thought his paragraphs held together well as written. As you revise your work in response to peer feedback, you may also choose to accept some suggestions while rejecting others.</para>
      <para id="para-00080">Byrd paid close attention to peer feedback indicating that his draft had many long, complicated sentences; in the draft below, the originals are noted after the edited sentences. He also acted on feedback about verb tense consistency. Furthermore, Byrd made proofreading changes, such as adding the MLA-required right header and changing the placement of some punctuation marks. As with all writing, this draft could be improved even more with further revision. After reading the essay, discuss with a peer the revision, editing, and proofreading changes you would recommend if you were reading this draft for peer review.</para>

      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00085">The realm of physical film, if not already dead, is dying. More so than decaying cellulose, the entire medium as an art form is declining. According to <emphasis effect="italics">The Guardian</emphasis>, DVD and Blu-Ray sales were down this past holiday over 30% each (Sweney). Some say that streaming services and on-demand viewing are the culprits. Whatever the case, the answer is not so simple, and the notion is very alarming. <emphasis effect="underline">The decrease in relevance of physical media is no secret. Mass closures of video rental powerhouses such as Blockbuster Video and Movie Gallery began at the turn of the decade.</emphasis></para>
      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00086"><emphasis effect="italics">The original sentence read: <emphasis effect="underline">It is no secret that physical media has been on the decline, especially with the mass closures of video rental powerhouses such as Blockbuster Video and Movie Gallery near the beginning of the decade.</emphasis> This example demonstrates a pattern throughout the revised draft in which Byrd broke apart some of his longer sentences and improved their wording. Notice that he changes tense in the last sentence for a reason: the trend is happening now, but video rental stores began closing in the past.</emphasis></para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00087">Though the memory lives on in millennial nostalgia, the world of physical movie sales is not completely irrelevant. Many of the large rental chains have since closed down, but beyond the major highways is an all-but-forgotten world of local video stores. In my home state, one store in particular, called Toad Frog Alley Videos, lives in that world, located in the small town of Cleveland, Alabama. I had the privilege of visiting the store and speaking with its owner, Kandy Little, about her experiences operating in a time when physical media is scarce. Through my visit and conversation, I have come to appreciate the importance of Toad Frog Alley Videos. I truly believe that the store provides a crucial and important service to its community, as well as highlights the nature of physical film and the need for preservation.</para>
      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00088"><emphasis effect="italics">In this introductory paragraph, Byrd establishes the stakes for his profile subject, offering both background and context for understanding the video store’s importance to its community.

      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00118">Why also are stores like Toad Frog Alley still operating? Back in 2010, when rental chains were beginning to close doors indefinitely, many entertainment news sites noticed a trend. Among them was <emphasis effect="italics">The Hollywood Reporter</emphasis>, which noted that over 35% of independent video stores had tanning beds. They reported the trend, saying, “[Independents] use every niche they can think of to survive and be respected in their communities” (Bond). While tanning beds may look like the supplemental savior for many locally owned stores, <emphasis effect="underline">this notion</emphasis></para>
      <para class="annotation-text" id="para-00119"><emphasis effect="italics">Here, Byrd defines the word</emphasis> this <emphasis effect="italics">by inserting the word</emphasis> notion<emphasis effect="italics">.</emphasis></para>

      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00122">Ironically, Kandy bought a tanning salon in hopes of opening a video store. At the time, there was a much higher demand for rentals in almost every community, and Toad Frog Alley was no exception. Though she admits tanning has increased over the years (with rentals, of course, declining), to Kandy, tanning was not the savior. “[Toad Frog Alley Videos] is still open because I work it myself most of the time,” she says. “No one else will take care of your business as well as you do.” With an inventory of over 5,000 films, Kandy believes that physical media is important for her community. Local business is important for creating jobs and city revenue, and Kandy provides both through her love of movies.</para>
      <para class="student-sample" id="para-00123">Even though Toad Frog Alley is doing well, the scarcity of rental stores is something to consider. In the digital age, media is accessible to practically everyone.
